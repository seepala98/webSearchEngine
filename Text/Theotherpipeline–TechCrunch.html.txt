Tech in an era of mass incarceration


Megan Rose Dickey @meganrosedickey / 6 years







Chrisfino Kenyatta Leal never thought he would end up in prison. What he did envision, he tells me, was dying before the age of 25 or 30.
“I saw so many people around me dying at such a young age that my long-term vision just wasn’t in focus,” Leal tells me. “I was just focused on what was right in front of me.”
In 1994, Leal was pulled over by the police for “being black and driving a nice car in an area where they probably thought I shouldn’t have been,” he says. A friend of Leal’s was in the car, and the police found a gun on him. Even though the friend testified that it was his gun, Leal was charged for constructive possession. It was his third strike. Sentence: 25 years to life.

Nineteen years later, at the age of 44, Leal walked out of prison. Against all odds, he made his way into the tech industry. You could say he’s one of the lucky ones.

Chrisfino Kenyatta Leal “I saw so many people around me dying at such a young age that my long-term vision just wasn’t in focus.”
When you hear about a “pipeline problem” in tech, it is often in regards to the lack of diversity in the Silicon Valley tech ecosystem. The crux of the pipeline argument is that there are not enough underrepresented minorities and women pursuing knowledge in computer science and programming.
Tech companies like Apple, Google and Facebook love to cite the so-called pipeline problem as the reason for the discrepancy between underrepresented minority groups and white people among their staff. Just this month, Facebook’s global head of diversity once again blamed the company’s meager amount of black and brown employees on a lack of available talent. This was met with criticism and anger among diversity and inclusion advocates across the tech industry.
While the pipeline is certainly a small part of the problem, there are other elements that impact diversity in tech — inclusion and belonging. It’s one thing to hire underrepresented minorities, but it’s another thing to make them feel included and wanted. What often results is the so-called “leaky bucket” phenomenon, which describes people of color entering a space and eventually leaving because of the unconscious biases they experience at the hands of their colleagues.
In the past year, the tech industry has started addressing unconscious bias in the workplace. Facebook, for example, has even gone so far as to build a resource site called “Managing Unconscious Bias,” with the idea that other tech companies can tap into Facebook’s best practices.

We have a criminal justice system that is inherently infected with racial bias.— Ana Zamora, criminal justice policy director, ACLU of N. California

What’s missing from the conversation, however, is the other pipeline — the criminal justice system. Systemic racism is at the root of this multi-faceted, other pipeline. It results in the disproportionate amount of underrepresented minorities, particularly black people, ending up behind bars — sometimes directly from the classroom.
Across the nation’s public schools, there are more than 43,000 school resource officers, which includes career law enforcement officers with the authority to arrest children and send them to jail, according to a National Center for Education Statistics report. This school-to-prison pipeline disproportionately affects young black and brown people.
“School discipline issues are still an important driver,” Ana Zamora, criminal justice policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, tells me. “Regressive and highly punitive school discipline policies have a tendency to funnel certain youth into a certain direction, and that’s the basis of the school-to-prison pipeline.”
Meanwhile, the lack of data makes it nearly impossible to quantify the effects of systemic racism on the criminal justice system. As it stands right now, there is no way of measuring and demonstrating patterns.
“I believe we have a criminal justice system that is inherently infected with racial bias, and that is a huge contributor. Whether or not it’s a pipeline, I don’t know, but it’s a huge contributor,” she says. “We’ve had some really highly punitive laws in place and tools for law enforcement to ensure certain people are going to be incarcerated.”
Zamora says it’s difficult to identify what is going on because we don’t actually have the information and so we can’t determine the patterns. There is a lack of data in the criminal justice system. In fact, there is barely any at all.
“We can’t analyze how and why law enforcement are making certain decisions or why certain people are charged with a felony and other people are charged with a misdemeanor for the exact same crime,” Zamora says. “This is information we need access to.”
The criminal justice system plays a significant, behind-the-scenes role in the lack of diversity in the tech industry today. And we can’t efficiently tackle diversity and inclusion in tech without first examining the criminal justice system.

The number of black people under the control of the correctional system is staggering.
Today, there are more African-American adults under correctional control — in prison, jail, on probation or on parole — “than were enslaved in 1850, a decade before the Civil War began,” writes legal scholar and author Michelle Alexander in her book “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,” citing numbers by the Pew Charitable Trust report “the Pew Center on the States.”
In the late 1950s, segregationists started to use law-and-order rhetoric geared toward getting white people to oppose the civil rights movement. They were responsible for the narrative that civil rights protests were a criminal act rather than a political one, their argument being that the protests were contributing to the spread of crime.
While there was an increase in crime during this time, the reasons for it were complex. The Baby Boom generation accounted for a spike in young men in the 15-to-24 age group, which has historically been responsible for most crimes. Alexander refers to this period, and the mass incarceration that has resulted from it, as “the new Jim Crow.”
“The surge of young men in the population was occurring at precisely the same time that unemployment rates for black men were rising sharply, but the economic and demographic factors contributing to rising crime were not explored in the media,” Alexander writes in her book (page 41). “Instead, crime reports were sensationalized and offered as further evidence of the breakdown in lawfulness, morality, and social stability in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement.”
After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which formally ended discrimination in public spaces, employment, voting and education, the public focus shifted to crime. When riots erupted after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, the racial imagery in the media associated with them helped to fuel the segregationists’ argument that civil rights for blacks led to an increase in crime. Meanwhile, between the 1960s and 1980, conservatives began to question welfare, pitting hard-working white people against black people who didn’t want to work.
“The not-so-subtle message to working-class whites was that their tax dollars were going to support special programs for blacks who most certainly did not deserve them,” Alexander writes in “The New Jim Crow” (page 48).
The turning point came in 1971 when President Richard Nixon called for a war on drugs and referred to illegal drugs as “public enemy number one.” Crime and welfare ultimately became the major themes of Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign in 1980, which used racially coded rhetoric and strategies.

President Ronald Reagan followed through with Nixon’s desires. Despite the fact that drug use was on the decline, in 1982 he officially declared a war on drugs, stating that illicit drugs were a threat to national security (“The Politics of Injustice: Crime and Punishment in America” by Katherine Beckett and Theodore Sasson, page 163).
Between 1980 and 1984, the FBI’s anti-drug funding increased from $8 million to $95 million, according to the Budget of the U.S. government in 1990 (Katherine Beckett, Making Crime Pay: Law and Order in Contemporary American Politics, page 53). In contrast, funding for agencies in charge of drug treatment, prevention and education was reduced. The budget for the National Institute on Drug Abuse, for example, went from $274 million in 1981 to $57 million in 1984, according to 1992 data from the U.S. Office of the National Drug Control Policy.
Meanwhile, in the early 1980s, inner-city communities were suffering from an economic collapse. Black inner-city communities were the ones that felt the impacts of globalization and deindustrialization the most.
As late as 1970, more than 70 percent of blacks working in metropolitan areas held blue-collar jobs (William Julius Wilson, When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban Poor). By 1987, the employment rate for black men dropped to 28 percent (John Kasarda, “Urban Industrial Transition and the Underclass,” Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 501, no. 1 [1990]).
In 1985, a few years after Reagan announced the war on drugs, crack cocaine hit the streets. Investigations have since suggested that the government played a role in embedding crack on the streets of inner-city black neighborhoods, as described in Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair’s book, “Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press” and by Michelle Alexander.
“The CIA admitted in 1998 that guerrilla armies it actively supported in Nicaragua were smuggling illegal drugs into the United States — drugs that were making their way onto the streets of inner-city black neighborhoods in the form of crack cocaine,“ Alexander writes in her book (page 6).
The lack of legitimate job opportunities in low-income black neighborhoods, combined with the infusion of illegal drugs into these neighborhoods, created an incentive to sell drugs. Reagan’s administration jumped on the opportunity to publicize the crack cocaine epidemic, sensationalizing its emergence. These sensationalized media campaigns continued to 1989.
During that time, the racism against blacks was fueled by the job loss created by the economic collapse and the crack epidemic that struck the streets of black neighborhoods. With that in mind, white people were in support of “getting tough on crime” initiatives, as well as anti-welfare measures. The war on drugs ultimately gave white people an easy way to discriminate against blacks and express hostility without being accused of racism.
This general attitude of getting tough on problems affecting people of color started in the 1960s, and it was mostly conservatives engaging in that sort of rhetoric. But by the late 1980s, Democrats hoping to take political control from Republicans began to participate. In order to do that, they had to win back the swing voters who were leaning toward the Republican Party because of its stance on crime and drugs. With both parties on board the “get tough on crime” train, jail and prison populations dramatically increased.

The number of people incarcerated for drug crimes in the U.S. went from 41,000 in 1980 to almost 500,000 in 2014, according to the Sentencing Project. The increase in the prison population disproportionately affected the African-American community, with one-fourth of young black men between the ages of 20-29 under the control of the criminal justice system in 1990, according to the Sentencing Project.
And according to a 2000 survey by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 6.4 percent of whites, 6.4 percent of blacks and 5.3 percent of Hispanics used illegal drugs. But despite these similar rates of drug use, black men are sent to state prison on drug charges at more than 13 times the rate of white men. There is a reason for the disparity.
When Bill Clinton was running for president, he said he would never let any Republican be perceived as tougher on crime than he was. During his first term in office, he signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.
The bill included the three-strikes provision that mandated a life sentence in prison without the possibility of parole for offenders convicted of three felony crimes or more. That $30 billion bill also introduced a number of new federal capital crimes and authorized more than $16 billion for state prison grants and the expansion of state and local police forces.
The Clinton administration’s policies on crime led to the largest increases in federal and state prison inmates of any American president in history, according to the Justice Policy Institute.
President Clinton then turned his attention to welfare policies, signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. The bill imposed a five-year limit on welfare assistance, as well as a lifetime ban on eligibility for food stamps and welfare for anyone convicted of felony drug use or possession, including possession of marijuana.
Clinton also made it easier for the government to refuse public housing to anyone with a criminal history. As a result, millions of poor people, especially the racial minorities targeted by the drug war, ended up homeless. Someone with a criminal record also has limited eligibility for federal student aid and must indicate if they have a felony conviction on their record when applying for jobs.
In 2002, more than 2 million people were behind bars in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Additionally, as a result of Clinton-era policies, millions more were still held prisoner of the criminal justice system once they were released by way of discrimination in employment, housing and access to education. And given the legal, discriminatory nature of society in the U.S., recidivism rates remain high.
Today, black and Latino people comprise about 1.5 million of the total 2.2 million people incarcerated in the U.S. adult correctional system, or 67 percent of the prison population, while making up just 37 percent of the total U.S. population, according to the Sentencing Project. That’s because black people are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of white people.

But black people aren’t incarcerated at higher rates than white people because they’re committing more crimes. Five times as many white people are using drugs as black people, for example, but African-Americans are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of white people.
Also, blacks serve almost as much time in prison for a drug offense (58.7 months) as white people do for a violent offense (61.7 months). There are millions of black adults who are thus unable to explore opportunities in tech, whether they want to or not.
Meanwhile, youth of color make up over 63 percent, or 22,669, of those committed to juvenile facilities, according to 2013 data from the Easy Access to the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement. That’s not including those who were sent to adult jails and prisons. As of 2014, there were 5,235 youth in adult jails, according to data analyzed by the Sentencing Project. Nationwide, blacks represent 37 percent of youths in jails, which brings that to 1,936 young black men in adult jails.
At the same time, young people of color who are impacted by the criminal justice system early in life are more likely to end up incarcerated later in life, are at risk of sexual assault and abuse in these juvenile centers and suffer from mental health issues (almost 70 percent) according to Child Trends Data Bank.
As is the purpose of any racial caste system, the function of mass incarceration is to define what race is, and it accomplishes the same thing that Jim Crow laws achieved: segregation of black people from mainstream society.
As Alexander writes, slavery in America defined black people as slaves, the Jim Crow era of discriminatory laws defined blacks as second-class citizens and the era of mass incarceration — our present-day racial caste — defines blacks as criminals.
In the U.S., the tech industry employs more than 6.7 million people and is a big part of the country’s economy. It has grown consecutively for the last five years, with tech today accounting for 7.1 percent of the U.S. GDP and 11.6 percent of total overall payroll in the private sector, according to nonprofit IT trade association CompTIA. This year, employment in the tech industry hit its highest growth rate in more than a decade.
Black people make up just 2 percent of the employee populations at Facebook, Google and Dropbox. We know this because, in the last couple of years, tech companies have become more willing to release their EEO-1 diversity data and put out diversity reports. Another recent trend has been the hiring of heads of diversity and inclusion. Unfortunately, these efforts seem to be falling short, as not much improvement has been made in terms of representation of people of color at tech companies.
Meanwhile, the number of underrepresented minorities at the board level is even lower. In 2014, there were only three black people and one Hispanic person sitting on the board of directors across 20 major tech companies, according to a survey by the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow PUSH Coalition. Jackson has played a big role in the push for diversity in tech by persistently demanding that companies release diversity data and commit to the hiring of underrepresented minorities at all levels of the company, including the board of directors.
Jackson and his organization have committed to this push because diversity in tech, he says, is the civil rights issue of our time.
“One civil rights movement was to end legal slavery,” Jackson told me in April. “Another was to end legal Jim Crow and the lynching season. That was a civil rights movement of that day. Another was the right to vote. You can abolish slavery, get rid of Jim Crow, and vote, and be broke and impoverished without access to capital, industry and technology, and deal flow and relationships. This is the civil rights of our time: access to capital, access to computers, how to make them, how to sell them.”

The absence of black people from tech is not a function of lack of interest, knowledge, skill or drive. Instead, there are a couple of issues at hand, both of which relate to systemic racism and discrimination. First is the fact that the tech industry is underutilizing the diverse talent pool.
“While there is some truth to the ‘pipeline’ theory and anxiety over the ability of the US educational system to provide a sufficiently large, well trained, and diverse labor pool, there are additional factors at play,” the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s latest report, Diversity In High Tech, states.
“For example, about nine percent of graduates from the nation’s top computer science programs are from underrepresented minority groups. However, only five percent of the large tech firm employees are from one of these groups. This presents the unlikely scenarios that either major employers in the field are unable to attract four out of nine underrepresented minority graduates from top schools or almost half of the minority graduates of top schools do not qualify for the positions for which they were educated.”

We’re fighting really systemic racism that’s been built into the fabric of not just these companies, but our nation in general.

— Kimberly Bryant, founder, Black Girls Code
Second is the institutionalized racism that has led to millions of people of color disappearing into prisons and jails, locked away for drug crimes that, when committed by white people, are largely ignored.
As a result, underrepresented minorities are either locked up behind bars or caught in the grasp of this country’s criminal justice system thanks to institutionalized racism, or they’re locked out of the tech industry thanks to prejudice and several covert acts of individual racism.
“We’re fighting really systemic racism that’s been built into the fabric of not just these companies, but our nation in general,” Black Girls Code founder Kimberly Bryant told me in February.
Being under the control of the criminal justice system negatively impacts one’s life chances and makes it legal to be discriminated against when applying for jobs, housing and loans. As a result, thousands of young people of color are missing out on opportunities to participate in traditional school, hackathons, coding schools and internships at tech companies.
To ensure that everyone has a fair chance to get into the tech industry, we need to focus on the other pipeline — the pipeline that leads to a disproportionate number of black people and other minorities ending up in prison.

Originally sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, Leal served 19 years of his sentence — first at Pelican Bay and then at San Quentin — thanks to both the enactment and amendment of California’s Three Strikes sentencing law.
Leal first entered the criminal justice system in 1991, when he pled guilty to two counts of robbery for stealing money from a safe and a cash register at one restaurant. That’s two counts for one robbery. Leal was released in 1994, which is when the Three Strikes Law was enacted, so those two counts for one robbery meant two strikes.
“I always had hope that I would get out,” Leal says. “That was something that stayed really, really clear in my head. I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. I didn’t care how much time they gave me or what anybody else said. I always believed that I was going to get out. I just didn’t know when. So it was really all about preparing myself for that opportunity so that when it did come, I’d be ready.”
In 2010, 16 years into his life sentence with no sign of getting out of prison anytime soon, Leal helped start The Last Mile inside San Quentin with Transmedia Capital General Partner Chris Redlitz. The Last Mile teaches people how to code and start their own companies. It partners with tech companies to help place participants in internships and paid roles once they’re released from prison. Leal graduated with the first cohort of men in 2012.
“When we were finishing our first class and we had guys who were preparing to get out, I went to some of the people in my portfolio and said, ‘We’ve got these guys. I think they’re prepared, but they’ve been in prison over 15 years and they don’t really know technology and they haven’t had a job in a long time’ and I really asked a favor of [tech companies] to participate in our internship program,” Redlitz tells me.
The former prisoners ended up excelling once they joined these tech companies. Leal is one of those employees Redlitz is referring to.
In 2012, California voters approved Proposition 36, which led to the amendment of the three strikes provision of the 1994 crime bill. Two main changes made to the law were that the third strike needed to be a serious or violent felony and that those currently serving a third-strike sentence could petition the court for reduction of their term to a second-strike sentence — if they would have been eligible for second-strike sentencing under the new law.
For Leal, that meant that he could meet with a judge for potential re-sentence. In 2013, Leal met with the same judge who originally sentenced him to 25 years to life. The judge re-sentenced Leal to seven years and a week later, Leal was released from prison.
“That was probably the best feeling I’ve ever felt,” Leal tells me. “It’s amazing. It’s one thing to be in prison, but to be in prison with a life sentence — I can’t even begin to explain how tough that is because you could literally die in prison. Who the hell wants to die in prison? There was the uncertainty of not knowing when you’re going to get out, which was really hard, so when I did walk out of there, it was probably one of the best moments of my life.”
While at The Last Mile inside San Quentin, Leal met RocketSpace CEO Duncan Logan, a friend of Redlitz’s, who says he had never been to a correctional facility before. RocketSpace is a co-working accelerator that has housed startups like Uber, Spotify and Leap Motion.
“I actually went in before the demo day to do some coaching,” Logan tells me. “That was when it kind of struck me. It just shattered all of my illusions of what I thought I would see or experience.” He tells me he sees the criminal justice system in a different way. Before, he was in the bucket of “if we remove [criminals], it’ll be a better place,” he tells me. “I was in a fairly common misunderstanding of what was going on with crime. Certainly in a total misunderstanding of what a correctional system is and what it could be — I think I’ve gone through a total transition on that.”
When demo day came around, Logan returned to San Quentin and was impressed by Leal’s presentation. Logan told Leal that if he ever got out, he would hire him. He kept his word. Of Leal, Logan says: “He’s achieving more than most of the staff sitting here.”
Leal joined RocketSpace in 2013, a year after he was released from San Quentin. Since then, he’s gone from moving furniture at RocketSpace to setting up IT equipment and doing some programming as RocketSpace’s manager of campus services. In transitioning from prison to the tech industry, Leal has seen a number of parallels.

It’s one thing to be in prison, but to be in prison with a life sentence — I can’t even begin to explain how tough that is because you could literally die in prison.

“One of the things that I noticed immediately about RocketSpace and this whole tech hub at RocketSpace is there’s a lot of energy there,” Leal says. “In prison there’s a lot of energy. The big difference is that so much of the energy in prison is chaotic. Inside RocketSpace, everything is focused on these goals and trying to get this product to market, raise money, be successful.
“So I think that inside prisons there’s this attitude of just making the most of whatever you have to work with. In prison, it’s all about the minimal viable product. There’s a parallel there as well. I think that one of the biggest parallels I’ve found about the entrepreneurship and tech world is that failure isn’t a bad thing. Failure is actually a good thing. You can learn things from failure.”
People in the tech industry have made some steps toward creating opportunities for those who have gone through the criminal justice system. It’s time to focus on what happens before people enter the criminal justice system.
In total, black people are more likely than white people in America to be arrested and, once arrested, blacks are more likely to be convicted, according to The Sentencing Project. And once convicted, blacks are more likely than whites to face harsh sentences.

Technology and data could play a big role in dismantling the system that leads to a disproportionate number of black men ending up in prison.
According to the ACLU’s Zamora, there is a lack of uniform data collection on the various phases of the criminal justice system.
“Everything from when people are stopped to all the way through a trial, as well as how decisions are made throughout the process and how those decisions are affecting different communities,” Zamora says. “So, there’s a big data void in criminal justice.”
With the help of technology, there could be a lot more transparency to the criminal justice system simply by surfacing the data the government does have.
Right now, a lot of people feel like there’s a bit of a black box around what’s going on in local police forces and in the system at large, Justin Erlich, special assistant attorney general, in the office of Attorney General Kamala Harris, tells me. That’s because, Erlich says, a lot of the tech and infrastructure that criminal justice agencies use are pretty old.
“It’s not necessarily that people are trying to hide or not share the data as much as it’s actually amazingly difficult, manually, to get out and extract data,” Erlich says. “I think that making sure we are all working together to get modern technology into all of these agencies is critical for us to really then be able to use APIs or extractions of the cloud to analyze and research what is going on.”
Erlich led the team that recently relaunched OpenJustice, an effort by the California Department of Justice to make law enforcement data more transparent. But in order to make serious strides, and move toward real-time criminal justice data reporting and better policies, Erlich says, we’ll need more public-private partnerships between the government and leading tech companies.

Getting more technology and the tech industry involved in criminal justice efforts pays dividends.

— Justin Erlich, special assistant attorney general, office of AG Kamala Harris
So far, Erlich says there has been some high-level support from companies like Facebook, for example, but a lot more support is needed.
Technology could also be helpful with better understanding how to reduce the number of those entering the criminal justice system through pre-trial and bail reform.
“Instead of locking people up, we can use technology to better keep track of folks, so they don’t have to enter the system in the first place,” Erlich says. “And on the backend, we can start training folks that will help diversify the technology pool. That’s not just simply from a demographic perspective but also from a worldview perspective. I think it’s important that a lot of people who end up touching the system are then put in places where they can take action to reform it.”
Not everybody goes through the criminal justice system, so there’s a lot of value in sharing that perspective with others, Erlich says.
“Getting more technology and the tech industry involved in criminal justice efforts pays dividends both for society itself but also directly to the tech industry,” Erlich says.
Meanwhile, the White House recently challenged artificial intelligence experts to help reform the criminal justice system. Speaking at a Computing Community Consortium workshop, Lynn Overmann, head of the White House Police Data Initiative, said AI and data analytics could be useful in improving questions on parole screenings, analyzing police body camera footage and in analyzing criminal justice data. Oakland, California, for example, has seen a drop in the use of force by both police and citizens since deploying body cameras.
That said, inserting technology into the criminal justice system doesn’t necessarily mean good will come from it. In certain states throughout the country, courts are using algorithmic software to predict the likelihood of someone committing a crime in the future. In analyzing risk scores from Broward Country, Florida, for instance, the investigative team at ProPublica found that the software used in the sentencing process is biased against blacks. However, the private company behind the software could work to overcome this bias if they decided to implement updates.
By reforming the criminal justice system, there’s also an opportunity to fill the so-called labor shortage in the tech industry. Through programs like The Last Mile and other proactive approaches to teaching tech skills to former prisoners, the tech industry could gain access to untapped talent while also tackling diversity.
“Unfortunately, we know we’ve sort of got two distinct diversity issues,” Erlich says. “One is in the tech sector. We don’t have the diverse labor set that we would hope for many reasons. Similarly, unfortunately, also again for many societal reasons, those who are entering the criminal justice system are not diverse in a different way, which is, they’re disproportionately minority and African-American and I think both of those results are an example of broader societal issues that we’re struggling with.
And they are sort of an opportunity for us to really focus on addressing both of those, which is how can we use technology better to understand how to reduce those entering the system.”
Addressing the problems of inequity and racial justice in the criminal justice system would allow for more opportunities for communities of color to thrive in many different ways.
”The criminal justice system really embodies a lot of our problems with race in our country,” Zamora says. “So if we can fix that, I do think we’ll see a lot of positive changes.”

It\u2019s important to keep in touch and know that everyone is fine, or as fine as is possible right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Besides my work as a COO, I\u2019ve been helping with volunteering, getting supplies and medicine to people, and this is something that pretty much every Ukrainian is now doing. I had my family relocated to Hungary, so I feel more or less safe, and I\u2019m just trying to work as much as possible and do my best in every possible area, whether that\u2019s supporting the company or supporting Ukraine in general.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n How are you managing your team through this crisis? What\u2019s changed?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>We got used to working remotely during Coronavirus times, so we have our task tracker, where everyone can see his or her task. Every Monday, we have an online Zoom meeting. Previously we only had these meetings at the executive level, but now during the war, we are gathering all together, just to see each other\u2019s faces and ask how they\u2019re doing, how\u2019s everyone feeling. Just to talk with everybody.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n <\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":" “Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues.

But second, and more immediately relevant in this case, you would not know that there is a technique to it that, surprisingly, robots aren’t super good at because they tend to be… crushy. But this robo-berry<\/a> designed by Swiss researchers could usher in a new era of gentle, automated robo-pickers.<\/p>\n The secret to picking a raspberry is to grip it just enough to get purchase and then pull it downwards off the little stem, apparently called the “receptacle,” which seems backwards. Seems simple \u2014 and it is, but only our hands are among the most sensitive and finely controlled constructions in the universe, the culmination of a hundred million years of evolution, outdone only by (I suspect) raccoons.<\/p>\n Robots simply don’t have the senses necessary to figure out the perfect technique for picking a berry. But what if it could communicate with the berry to better sense the forces involved and avoid either a a brutal crushing or humiliating failure-to-detach?<\/p> <\/div>\n That’s what Kai Junge, a PhD student at EPFL in Switzerland, aims to accomplish with this “sensorized raspberry,” a silicone and silicon replica berry that provides feedback to the picking machine, allowing it to learn to pick faster and better \u2014 and cleaner.<\/p>\n “It\u2019s an exciting dilemma for us as robotics engineers,” said professor Josie Hughes, who worked with Junge on the project. “The raspberry harvesting season is so short, and the fruit is so valuable, that wasting them simply isn’t an option. What’s more, the cost and logistical challenges of testing different options out in the field are prohibitive. That\u2019s why we decided to run our tests in the lab and develop a replica raspberry for training harvesting robots.”<\/p>\n Apparently the hard part comes just at the moment of detaching, when the force needed to grip the berry on the receptacle suddenly becomes overkill as the object goes from solid to hollow.<\/p>\n The replica berry has a fluidic sensor that tells the system how much compression is being experienced by the silicone drooplets, allowing the control model to learn how to adjust its grip as if the berry itself is telling it how much is too much.<\/p>\n You can see the berry in action below:<\/p>\n <\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The team plans to present their work at RobotSoft in April. And once the raspberry question is decided, they may move on to other berries, tomatoes, grapes&#8230; even apricots.

acquired <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minit.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minit<\/a>, a Bratislava, Slovakia-originated process mining technology vendor, for an undisclosed sum, the companies announced today. Microsoft says that the purchase will &#8220;further empower&#8221; it to &#8220;help &#8230; customers digitally transform&#8221; by creating a more complete picture of their processes &#8212; and identifying which of those processes are ripe for automation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Minit currently enables businesses to transform the way they analyze, monitor and optimize their processes. Minit\u2019s solutions have helped businesses gain deep insights into how processes run, uncover root causes of operational challenges and help mitigate undesired process outcomes,&#8221; Justin Graham, Microsoft&#8217;s general manager of process insights, wrote in a <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.microsoft.com\/blog\/2022\/03\/31\/microsoft-acquires-minit-to-strengthen-process-mining-capabilities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post<\/a> on Microsoft&#8217;s corporate blog. &#8220;[With Minit, our] customers will be able to better understand their process data, uncover what operations look like in reality, and drive process standardization and improvement across the entire organization to ensure compliance at every step.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft dipped its toes into process mining with the launch of new features in Power Automate in 2019 and the acquisition of Softomotive, an RPA software provider, a year later. But with Minit, the tech giant is doubling down on a software category that could be worth over $11 billion by 2030, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wfmz.com\/news\/pr_newswire\/pr_newswire_technology\/global-process-mining-software-market-size-value-estimated-to-reach-usd-11-096-7-million\/article_a95b3354-ec2f-5389-b761-e4dbbdadbb97.html#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20report%20published,forecast%20period%202022%20to%202030.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according<\/a> to a report from Polaris Market Research.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292372\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear whether the whole of the Minit team will join Microsoft &#8212; or, indeed, whether the company will remain spread across its current locations. (Minit is now headquartered in Amsterdam, with satellite offices in London and New York.) But CEO James Dening said that customers shouldn&#8217;t expect a change in the level of support they&#8217;re currently receiving.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to what it means to become part of an industry leader like Microsoft and what that brings us &#8212; how we can use that scale and excellence to continue to deliver great solutions to our customers,&#8221; Dening wrote in a blog <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minit.io\/blog\/microsoft-minit-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post<\/a> on Minit&#8217;s website. &#8220;It has been a privilege to lead the company for the last year, and I\u2019m excited to continue my journey with the team, as part of what I consider to be the world\u2019s leading software company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Microsoft spokesperson Zara Huang told TechCrunch that the Minit team will move into the\u00a0<span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> Process Insights team and that there will be &#8220;no change&#8221; to the current work location of Minit team members. <span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> is in early stages of determining how Minit will be integrated into its offerings, she said, and the companies will share more details when they&#8217;re available.<\/p>\n<p>Minit, which was founded in 2015 by Rasto Hlavac and had raised \u20ac10.3 million (~$11.40 million) prior to the acquisition, is one of an expanding number of startups developing process mining tools aimed at enterprise clientele. Process mining, also known as task discovery, involves spotting root cause workflow issues and bottlenecks by pulling data from systems including desktop, email apps and workflows. It&#8217;s a key part of robotic process automation (RPA), a technology that promises to automate monotonous, repetitive tasks traditionally performed by human workers while at the same time generating logs to identify potential cost savings.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As Protocol&#8217;s Aisha Counts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/bulletins\/microsoft-process-mining-minit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notes<\/a>, process mining has traditionally been done by system integrators who map out processes by analyzing manual workflows. Process mining software is designed to digitize the approach in a way that reduces the expense, time and effort involved.<\/p>\n<p>Underlining the appetite for process mining technologies, Celonis, a data processing company, earlier this week acquired Minit competitor Process Analytics Factory, which coincidentally integrates with Microsoft&#8217;s Power BI analytics platform. Just in the past several years, RPA vendor Automation Anywhere acquired process discovery and mining startups FortressIQ, Process Gold\\ and StepShot; Blue Prism released a task mining solution called Capture; and rivals including ABBYY and Kryon have expanded their process mining offerings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/\">Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=wqSRCOP7wQ#?secret=2NKiKfcj0k\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;You know the process space is hot when even Microsoft, with its vast resources, has to buy its way in.

been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robotics-roundup-12\/\">focused on pizza<\/a>. I\u2019ve long posited that this is for two key reasons. First: People like pizza. We eat a lot of it. Americans alone eat three billion pizzas a year. Second: It\u2019s relatively easy to make. The dough provides a fairly straightforward platform onto which ingredients are added.<\/p>\n<p>I say \u201cfairly\u201d here because there are still complications. There\u2019s really no such thing as easy when it comes to building robots that can execute variations on a task at a large scale. Here it\u2019s the dough that presents the problem. Turning a soft and malleable ball of dough into a pizza crust is one of those things humans have figured out how to do efficiently, but it still proves difficult for robot workers.<\/p>\n<p>A team of researchers at MIT, CMU and UC San Diego set out to create what they\u2019ve deemed \u201ccomplex dough-manipulation.\u201d The system is separated into a two-step process, in which the robot must first determine the task and then execute it using a tool like a rolling pin. The system, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2022\/robotic-deformable-object-0331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DiffSkill<\/a>, involves teaching robots complex tasks in simulations.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292473\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>MIT notes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A \u201cteacher\u201d algorithm solves each step the robot must take to complete the task. Then, it trains a \u201cstudent\u201d machine-learning model that learns abstract ideas about when and how to execute each skill it needs during the task, like using a rolling pin. With this knowledge, the system reasons about how to execute the skills to complete the entire task.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The researchers say the system outperformed those trained in the more traditional reinforcement learning model. \u201cOur framework provides a novel way for robots to acquire new skills. These skills can then be chained to solve more complex tasks which are beyond the capability of previous robot systems,\u201d says CSAIL grad student, Yunzhu Li.<\/p>\n<p>This is robotics, so the whole pizza thing is really an initial problem for a system designed to tackle a lot more tasks. The company points to the emerging field of eldercare robotics as a possible use going forward.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A disproportionate number of the early industrial food-making robots we\u2019ve seen have been focused on pizza.

The crux of the pipeline argument is that there are not enough underrepresented minorities and women pursuing knowledge in computer science and programming. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech companies like Apple, Google and Facebook love to cite the so-called pipeline problem as the reason for the discrepancy between underrepresented minority groups and white people among their staff. Just this month, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2016\/07\/14\/facebook-diversity-report-code-org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook\u2019s global head of diversity once again blamed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the company\u2019s meager amount of black and brown employees on a lack of available talent. This was met with criticism and anger among diversity and inclusion advocates across the tech industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the pipeline is certainly a small part of the problem, there are other elements that impact diversity in tech \u2014 inclusion<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and belonging. It\u2019s one thing to hire underrepresented minorities, but it\u2019s another thing to make them feel included and wanted. What\u00a0often results is the so-called \u201cleaky bucket\u201d phenomenon, which describes people of color entering a space and eventually leaving because of\u00a0the unconscious biases they experience at the hands of their colleagues. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past year, the tech industry has started addressing unconscious bias in the workplace. Facebook, for example, has even gone so far as to build a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/managingbias.fb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">resource site called \u201cManaging Unconscious Bias,<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d with the idea that other tech companies can tap into Facebook\u2019s best practices.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We have a criminal justice system that is inherently infected with racial bias.<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u2014 Ana Zamora, criminal justice policy director, ACLU of N.

Systemic racism is at the root of this multi-faceted, other pipeline. It results in the disproportionate amount of underrepresented minorities, particularly black people, ending up behind bars \u2014 sometimes directly from the classroom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across the nation\u2019s public schools, there are more than 43,000 school resource officers, which includes career law enforcement officers with the authority to arrest children and send them to jail, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/nces.ed.gov\/pubs2015\/2015051.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to a National Center for Education Statistics report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This school-to-prison pipeline disproportionately affects young black and brown people. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSchool discipline issues are still an important driver,\u201d Ana Zamora, criminal justice policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, tells me. \u201cRegressive and highly punitive school discipline policies have a tendency to\u00a0funnel certain youth into a certain direction, and that\u2019s the basis of the school-to-prison pipeline.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the lack of data makes it nearly impossible to quantify the effects of systemic racism on the criminal justice system. As it stands right now, there is no way of measuring and demonstrating patterns.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI believe we have a criminal justice system that is inherently infected with racial bias, and that is a huge contributor. Whether or not it\u2019s a pipeline, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s a huge contributor,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some really highly punitive laws in place and tools for law enforcement to ensure certain people are going to be incarcerated.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zamora says it\u2019s difficult to identify what is going on because we don\u2019t actually have the information and so we can\u2019t determine the patterns. There is a lack of data in the criminal justice system. In fact, there is barely any at all. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can\u2019t analyze how and why law enforcement are making certain decisions or\u00a0why certain people are charged with a felony and other people are charged with a misdemeanor for the exact same crime,\u201d Zamora says. \u201cThis is information we need access to.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The criminal justice system plays a significant, behind-the-scenes role in the lack of diversity in the tech industry today.

Despite the fact that drug use was on the decline, in 1982 he officially declared a war on drugs, stating that illicit drugs were a threat to national security (\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Politics-Injustice-Crime-Punishment-America\/dp\/0761929940\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Politics of Injustice: Crime and Punishment in America<\/a>\u201d by Katherine Beckett and Theodore Sasson, page 163).<\/p>\n<p>Between 1980 and 1984, the FBI\u2019s anti-drug funding increased from $8 million to $95 million, according to the Budget of the U.S. government in 1990 (Katherine Beckett, <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=GthgEFCEQNIC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=budget+for+national+institute+on+drug+abuse+274+million&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LaSNdByOHX&amp;sig=MW-dJoBc0_iVcC-I5M76VHafSIc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixoqDkr4XOAhVJ72MKHUxLA1kQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=budget%20for%20national%20institute%20on%20drug%20abuse%20274%20million&amp;f=false\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Making Crime Pay: Law and Order in Contemporary American Politics<\/a>, page 53). In contrast, funding for agencies in charge of drug treatment, prevention and education was reduced. The budget for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.drugabuse.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Institute on Drug Abuse<\/a>, for example, went from $274 million in 1981 to $57 million in 1984, according to 1992 data from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/ondcp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. Office of the National Drug Control Policy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in the early 1980s, inner-city communities were suffering from an economic collapse. Black inner-city communities were the ones that felt the impacts of globalization and deindustrialization the most.<\/p>\n<p>As late as 1970, more than 70 percent of blacks working in metropolitan areas held blue-collar jobs (William Julius Wilson, <a href=\"http:\/\/library.bsl.org.au\/jspui\/bitstream\/1\/294\/1\/CASEpaper%20no17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When Work Disappears: The World of the New Urban Poor<\/a>). By 1987, the employment rate for black men dropped to 28 percent (John Kasarda, \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/ann.sagepub.com\/content\/501\/1\/26.short?rss=1&amp;ssource=mfc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Urban Industrial Transition and the Underclass<\/a>,\u201d Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 501, no. 1 [1990]).<\/p>\n<p>In 1985, a few years after Reagan announced the war on drugs, crack cocaine hit the streets. Investigations have since suggested that the government <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/library\/reports\/general-reports-1\/cocaine\/contra-story\/intro.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">played a role in embedding crack<\/a> on the streets of inner-city black neighborhoods, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Whiteout-Drugs-Press-Alexander-Cockburn\/dp\/1859841392\/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as described in Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair\u2019s book, \u201cWhiteout: The CIA, Drugs and the Press<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d and by Michelle Alexander.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CIA admitted in 1998<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that guerrilla armies it actively supported in Nicaragua were smuggling illegal drugs into the United States \u2014 drugs that were making their way onto the streets of inner-city black neighborhoods in the form of crack cocaine,\u201c Alexander writes in her book (page 6).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The lack of legitimate job opportunities in low-income black neighborhoods, combined\u00a0with the infusion of illegal drugs into these neighborhoods, created an incentive to sell drugs. Reagan\u2019s administration jumped on the opportunity to publicize the crack cocaine epidemic, sensationalizing its emergence. These sensationalized media campaigns continued to 1989.<\/p>\n<p>During that time, the racism against blacks was fueled by the job loss created by the economic collapse and the crack epidemic that struck the streets of black neighborhoods. With that in mind, white people were in support of \u201cgetting tough on crime\u201d initiatives, as well as anti-welfare measures. The war on drugs ultimately gave white people an easy way to discriminate against blacks and express hostility without being accused of racism.<\/p>\n<p>This\u00a0general attitude of getting tough on problems affecting people of color started in the 1960s, and it was mostly conservatives engaging in that sort of rhetoric. But by the late 1980s, Democrats hoping to take\u00a0political control from Republicans began to participate. In order to do that, they had to win back the swing voters who were leaning toward the Republican Party because of its stance on crime and drugs.\u00a0With both parties on board the \u201cget tough on crime\u201d train, jail and prison populations dramatically increased.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1357822\" src=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/people-in-prisons-and-jails-for-drug-offenses-1980-and-2014.png\" alt=\"people-in-prisons-and-jails-for-drug-offenses-1980-and-2014\" width=\"938\" height=\"826\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/people-in-prisons-and-jails-for-drug-offenses-1980-and-2014.png 938w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/people-in-prisons-and-jails-for-drug-offenses-1980-and-2014.png?resize=150,132 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/people-in-prisons-and-jails-for-drug-offenses-1980-and-2014.png?resize=300,264 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/people-in-prisons-and-jails-for-drug-offenses-1980-and-2014.png?resize=768,676 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/people-in-prisons-and-jails-for-drug-offenses-1980-and-2014.png?resize=680,599 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/people-in-prisons-and-jails-for-drug-offenses-1980-and-2014.png?resize=50,44 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The number of people incarcerated for drug crimes in the U.S. went from 41,000 in 1980 to almost 500,000 in 2014, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sentencingproject.org\/criminal-justice-facts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to the Sentencing Project<\/a>. The increase in the prison population disproportionately affected the African-American community, with one-fourth of young black men between the ages of 20-29 under the control of the criminal justice system in 1990, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sentencingproject.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Young-Black-Americans-and-the-Criminal-Justice-System-Five-Years-Later.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to the Sentencing Project<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And according to a <a href=\"http:\/\/files.eric.ed.gov\/fulltext\/ED466907.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2000 survey by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services<\/a>, 6.4 percent of whites, 6.4 percent of blacks and 5.3 percent of Hispanics used illegal drugs. But despite these similar rates of drug use,\u00a0black men are sent to state prison on drug charges at more than 13 times the rate of white men. There is a reason for the disparity.<\/p>\n<p>When Bill Clinton was<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1992\/07\/24\/us\/1992-campaign-democrats-clinton-houston-speech-assails-bush-crime-issue.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> running for president<\/a>, he said he would <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thenation.com\/article\/hillary-clinton-does-not-deserve-black-peoples-votes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">never let any Republican be perceived as tougher on crime than he was<\/a>. During his first term in office, he signed the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncjrs.gov\/txtfiles\/billfs.txt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The bill included the three-strikes provision that mandated a life sentence in prison without the possibility of parole for offenders convicted of three felony crimes or more. That $30 billion bill also introduced a number of new federal capital crimes and authorized more than $16 billion for state prison grants and the expansion of state and local police forces.<\/p>\n<p>The Clinton administration\u2019s policies on crime led to\u00a0the largest increases in federal and state prison inmates of any American president in history, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.justicepolicy.org\/research\/2061\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to the Justice Policy Institute<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>President Clinton then turned his attention to welfare policies, signing\u00a0the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/fdsys\/pkg\/BILLS-104hr3734enr\/pdf\/BILLS-104hr3734enr.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act<\/a>. The bill\u00a0imposed a five-year limit on welfare assistance, as well as a lifetime ban on eligibility for food stamps and welfare for anyone convicted of felony drug use or possession, including possession of marijuana.<\/p>\n<p>Clinton also made it easier for the government to refuse public housing to anyone with a criminal history. As a result, millions of poor people, especially the racial minorities targeted by the drug war, ended up homeless.\u00a0Someone with a criminal record also has <a href=\"https:\/\/studentaid.ed.gov\/sa\/eligibility\/criminal-convictions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">limited eligibility for federal student aid<\/a> and must indicate if they have a felony conviction on their record when applying for jobs.<\/p>\n<p>In 2002, more than 2 million people were behind bars in the U.S., <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bjs.gov\/content\/pub\/press\/p02pr.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics<\/a>. Additionally, as a result of Clinton-era policies, millions more were still held prisoner of\u00a0the criminal justice system once they were released by way of discrimination in employment, housing and access to education.\u00a0And given the legal, discriminatory nature of society in the U.S., recidivism rates remain high.<\/p>\n<p>Today, black and Latino people comprise about 1.5 million of the total <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bjs.gov\/content\/pub\/pdf\/cpus14.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2.2 million people incarcerated in the U.S.<\/a> adult correctional system, or 67 percent of the prison population, while making up just 37 percent of the total U.S. population, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sentencingproject.org\/criminal-justice-facts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to the Sentencing Project<\/a>.

Five times as many white people are using drugs as black people, for example, but African-Americans are sent to prison for drug offenses at 10 times the rate of white people.<\/p>\n<p>Also, blacks serve almost as much time in prison for a drug offense (58.7 months) as white people do for a violent offense (61.7 months). There are millions of black adults who are thus unable to explore opportunities in tech, whether they want to or not.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, youth of color make up over 63 percent, or 22,669, of those committed to juvenile facilities, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ojjdp.gov\/ojstatbb\/ezacjrp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to 2013 data from the Easy Access to the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement<\/a>. That\u2019s not including those who were sent to adult jails and prisons. As of 2014, there were 5,235 youth in adult jails, according to data analyzed by the Sentencing Project. Nationwide, blacks represent 37 percent of youths in jails, which brings that to 1,936 young black men in adult jails.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, young people of color who are impacted by the criminal justice system early in life are more likely to end up incarcerated later in life, are at risk of sexual assault and abuse in these juvenile centers and suffer from mental health issues (almost 70 percent) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.childtrends.org\/?indicators=juvenile-detention\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to Child Trends Data Bank<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As is the purpose of any racial caste system, the function of mass incarceration is to define what race is, and it accomplishes the same thing that Jim Crow laws achieved: segregation of black people from mainstream society.<\/p>\n<p>As Alexander writes, slavery in America defined black people as slaves, the Jim Crow era of discriminatory laws defined blacks as second-class citizens and the era of mass incarceration \u2014 our present-day racial caste \u2014 defines blacks as criminals.<\/p>\n<p>In the U.S., the tech industry employs more than 6.7 million people and is a big part of the country\u2019s economy. It has grown consecutively for the last five years, with tech today accounting for 7.1 percent of the U.S. GDP and 11.6 percent of total overall payroll in the private sector, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comptia.org\/resources\/cyberstates-2016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to nonprofit IT trade association CompTIA<\/a>. This year, employment in the tech industry hit its highest growth rate in more than a decade.<\/p>\n<p>Black people make up just 2 percent of the employee populations at Facebook, Google and Dropbox. We know this because, in the last couple of years, tech companies have become\u00a0more willing to release their EEO-1 diversity data and put out <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/tag\/diversity-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">diversity reports<\/a>. Another recent trend has been the <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2015\/09\/07\/why-are-tech-companies-really-looking-for-heads-of-diversity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hiring of heads of diversity and inclusion<\/a>. Unfortunately, these efforts seem to be falling short, as not much improvement has been made in terms of representation of people of color at tech companies.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the number of underrepresented minorities at the board level is even lower.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2014, there were only three black people and one Hispanic person sitting on the board of directors across 20 major tech companies, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rainbowpush.org\/index.php\/news_links\/single\/usa_today_rainbow_push_survey_-_few_blacks_hispanics_among_top_tech_executi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">according to a survey by the Rev. Jesse Jackson\u2019s Rainbow PUSH Coalition<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Jackson has played a big role in the push for diversity in tech by persistently demanding that companies release diversity data and commit to the hiring of underrepresented minorities at all levels of the company, including the board of directors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Jackson and his organization have committed to this push because diversity in tech, he\u00a0says, is the civil rights issue of our time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne civil rights movement was to end legal slavery,\u201d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2016\/04\/28\/the-fire-inside-rev-jesse-jackson\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jackson told me in April<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cAnother was to end legal Jim Crow and the lynching season. That was a civil rights movement of that day. Another was the right to vote. You can abolish slavery, get rid of Jim Crow, and vote, and be broke and impoverished without access to capital, industry and technology, and deal flow and relationships. This is the civil rights of our time: access to capital, access to computers, how to make them, how to sell them.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block;\"><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/AGiKU9BZYH0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The absence of black people from tech is not a function of lack of interest, knowledge, skill or drive.

However, only five percent of the large tech firm employees are from one of these groups. This presents the unlikely scenarios that either major employers in the field are unable to attract four out of nine underrepresented minority graduates from top schools or almost half of the minority graduates of top schools do not qualify for the positions for which they were educated.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>We\u2019re fighting really systemic racism that\u2019s been built into the fabric of not just these companies, but our nation in general.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote-author-pos\">\u2014 Kimberly Bryant, founder, Black Girls Code<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second is the institutionalized racism that has led to millions of people of color disappearing into prisons and jails, locked away for drug crimes that, when committed by white people, are largely ignored. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>As a result, underrepresented minorities are either locked up behind bars or caught in the grasp of this country\u2019s criminal justice system thanks to institutionalized racism, or they\u2019re locked out of the tech industry thanks to prejudice and several covert acts of individual racism.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re fighting really systemic racism that\u2019s been built into the fabric of not just these companies, but our nation in general,\u201d <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blackgirlscode.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Girls Code<\/a> founder Kimberly Bryant<a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2016\/02\/01\/black-girls-code-founder-kimberly-bryant-on-racism-and-implicit-bias\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> told me in February<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Being under the control of the criminal justice system negatively impacts one\u2019s life chances and makes it legal to be discriminated against when applying for jobs, housing and loans.

That\u2019s two counts for one robbery. Leal was released in 1994, which is when the Three Strikes Law was enacted, so those two counts for one robbery meant two strikes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI always had hope that I would get out,\u201d Leal says. \u201cThat was something that stayed really, really clear in my head. I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. I didn\u2019t care how much time they gave me or what anybody else said. I always believed that I was going to get out. I just didn\u2019t know when. So it was really all about preparing myself for that opportunity so that when it did come, I\u2019d be ready.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2010, 16 years into his life sentence with no sign of getting out of prison anytime soon, Leal helped start <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/thelastmile.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Last Mile<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> inside San Quentin with Transmedia Capital General Partner Chris Redlitz. The Last Mile teaches people how to code and start their own companies. It partners with tech companies to help place participants in internships and paid roles once they\u2019re released from prison. Leal graduated with the first cohort of men in 2012.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen we were finishing our first class and we had guys who were preparing to get out, I went to some of the people in my portfolio and said, \u2018We\u2019ve got these guys. I think they\u2019re prepared, but they\u2019ve been in prison over 15 years and they don\u2019t really know technology and they haven\u2019t had a job in a long time\u2019 and I really asked a favor of [tech companies] to participate in our internship program,\u201d Redlitz tells me.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The former prisoners ended up excelling once they joined these tech companies. Leal is one of those employees Redlitz is referring to.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2012, California voters <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.courts.ca.gov\/20142.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approved Proposition 36<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which led to the amendment of the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">three strikes provision of the 1994 crime bill. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two main changes made to the law were that the third strike needed to be a serious or violent felony and that those currently serving a third-strike sentence could petition the court for reduction of their term to a second-strike sentence \u2014 if they would have been eligible for second-strike sentencing under the new law. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Leal, that meant that he could meet with a judge for potential re-sentence. In 2013, Leal met with the same judge who originally sentenced him to 25 years to life. The judge re-sentenced Leal to seven years and a week later, Leal was released from prison.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat was probably the best feeling I\u2019ve ever felt,\u201d Leal tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s one thing to be in prison, but to be in prison with a life sentence \u2014 I can\u2019t even begin to explain how tough that is because you could literally die in prison. Who the hell wants to die in prison? There was the uncertainty of not knowing when you\u2019re going to get out, which was really hard, so when I did walk out of there, it was probably one of the best moments of my life.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While at The Last Mile inside San Quentin, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal met RocketSpace CEO Duncan Logan, a friend of Redlitz\u2019s, who says he had never been to a correctional facility before. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rocketspace.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RocketSpace<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a co-working accelerator that has housed startups like Uber, Spotify and Leap Motion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI actually went in before the demo day to do some coaching,\u201d Logan tells me. \u201cThat was when it kind of struck me. It just shattered all of my illusions of what I thought I would see or experience.\u201d He tells me he sees the criminal justice system in a different way. Before, he was in the bucket of \u201cif we remove [criminals], it\u2019ll be a better place,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI was in a fairly common misunderstanding of what was going on with crime. Certainly in a total misunderstanding of what a correctional system is and what it could be \u2014 I think I\u2019ve gone through a total transition on that.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When demo day came around, Logan returned to San Quentin and was impressed by Leal\u2019s presentation. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Logan told Leal that if he ever got out, he would hire him. He kept his word. Of Leal, Logan says: <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHe\u2019s achieving more than most of the staff sitting here.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leal joined RocketSpace in 2013, a year after he was released from San Quentin. Since then, he\u2019s gone from moving furniture at RocketSpace to setting up IT equipment and doing some programming as RocketSpace\u2019s manager of campus services. In transitioning from prison to the tech industry, Leal has seen a number of parallels.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>It\u2019s one thing to be in prison, but to be in prison with a life sentence \u2014 I can\u2019t even begin to explain how tough that is because you could literally die in prison.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote-author-pos\">\u2014 Chrisfino Kenyatta Leal<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOne of the things that I noticed immediately about RocketSpace and this whole tech hub at RocketSpace is there\u2019s a lot of energy there,\u201d Leal says. \u201cIn prison there\u2019s a lot of energy. The big difference is that so much of the energy in prison is chaotic. Inside RocketSpace, everything is focused on these goals and trying to get this product to market, raise money, be successful. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSo I think that inside prisons there\u2019s this attitude of just making the most of whatever you have to work with. In prison, it\u2019s all about the minimal viable product. There\u2019s a parallel there as well. I think that one of the biggest parallels I\u2019ve found about the entrepreneurship and tech world is that failure isn\u2019t a bad thing. Failure is actually a good thing. You can learn things from failure.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People in the tech industry have made some steps toward creating opportunities for those who have gone through the criminal justice system. It\u2019s time to focus on what happens before people enter the criminal justice system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, black people are more likely than white people in America to be arrested and, once arrested, blacks are more likely to be convicted, according to The Sentencing Project. And once convicted, blacks are more likely than whites to face harsh sentences.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1357828\" src=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/lifetime-likelihood-of-imprisonment-by-race.png\" alt=\"lifetime-likelihood-of-imprisonment-by-race\" width=\"1024\" height=\"770\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/lifetime-likelihood-of-imprisonment-by-race.png 1173w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/lifetime-likelihood-of-imprisonment-by-race.png?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/lifetime-likelihood-of-imprisonment-by-race.png?resize=300,226 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/lifetime-likelihood-of-imprisonment-by-race.png?resize=768,577 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/lifetime-likelihood-of-imprisonment-by-race.png?resize=680,511 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/lifetime-likelihood-of-imprisonment-by-race.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology and data could play a big role in dismantling the system that leads to a disproportionate number of black men ending up in prison.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the ACLU\u2019s Zamora, there is a lack of uniform data collection on the various phases of the criminal justice system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEverything from when people are stopped to all the way through a trial, as well as how decisions are made throughout the process and how those decisions are affecting different communities,\u201d Zamora says. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a big data void in criminal justice.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the help of technology, there could be a lot more transparency to the criminal justice system simply by surfacing the data the government does have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, a lot of people feel like there\u2019s a bit of a black box around what\u2019s going on in local police forces and in the system at large, Justin Erlich, special assistant attorney general, in the office of Attorney General Kamala Harris, tells me. That\u2019s because, Erlich says, a lot of the tech and infrastructure that criminal justice agencies use are pretty old.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that people are trying to hide or not share the data as much as it\u2019s actually amazingly difficult, manually, to get out and extract data,\u201d Erlich says. \u201cI think that making sure we are all working together to get modern technology into all of these agencies is critical for us to really then be able to use APIs or extractions of the cloud to analyze and research what is going on.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Erlich led the team that recently relaunched <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/openjustice.doj.ca.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OpenJustice<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2016\/02\/17\/california-dojs-openjustice-platform-makes-local-law-enforcement-data-more-transparent\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an effort by the California Department of Justice to make law enforcement data more transparent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But in order to make serious strides, and move toward real-time criminal justice data reporting and better policies, Erlich says, we\u2019ll need more public-private partnerships between the government and leading tech companies. <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote\"><p>Getting more technology and the tech industry involved in criminal justice efforts pays dividends.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"pullquote-author-pos\">\u2014 Justin Erlich, special assistant attorney general, office of AG Kamala Harris<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, Erlich says there has been some high-level support from companies like Facebook, for example, but a lot more support is needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology could also be helpful with better understanding how to reduce the number of those entering the criminal justice system through pre-trial and bail reform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cInstead of locking people up, we can use technology to better keep track of folks, so they don\u2019t have to enter the system in the first place,\u201d Erlich says. \u201cAnd on the backend, we can start training folks that will help diversify the technology pool. That\u2019s not just simply from a demographic perspective but also from a worldview perspective. I think it\u2019s important that a lot of people who end up touching the system are then put in places where they can take action to reform it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not everybody goes through the criminal justice system, so there\u2019s a lot of value in sharing that perspective with others, Erlich says.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cGetting more technology and the tech industry involved in criminal justice efforts pays dividends both for society itself but also directly to the tech industry,\u201d Erlich says.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.govtech.com\/White-House-Challenges-Artificial-Intelligence-Experts-to-Reduce-Incarceration-Rates.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the White House recently challenged artificial intelligence experts to help reform the criminal justice system<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Speaking at a Computing Community Consortium workshop, Lynn Overmann, head of the White House Police Data Initiative, said AI and data analytics could be useful in improving questions on parole screenings, analyzing police body camera footage and in analyzing criminal justice data. Oakland, California, for example, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com\/2014\/12\/17\/oakland-mayor-says-police-body-cameras-have-cut-use-of-force-incidents-by-60-in-4-years-jean-quan-oakland-police-department-opd-officer-involved-shooting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has seen a drop in the use of force by both police and citizens<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since deploying body cameras<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, inserting technology into the criminal justice system doesn\u2019t necessarily mean good will come from it. In certain states throughout the country, courts are using algorithmic software to predict the likelihood of someone committing a crime in the future. In analyzing risk scores from Broward Country, Florida, for instance,\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.propublica.org\/article\/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the investigative team at ProPublica <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">found that the software used in the sentencing process is biased against blacks. However, the private company behind the software could work to overcome this bias if they decided to implement updates.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By reforming the criminal justice system, there\u2019s also an opportunity to fill the so-called labor shortage in the tech industry. Through programs like The Last Mile and other proactive approaches to teaching tech skills to former prisoners, the tech industry could gain access to untapped talent while also tackling diversity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cUnfortunately, we know we\u2019ve sort of got two distinct diversity issues,\u201d Erlich says. \u201cOne is in the tech sector. We don\u2019t have the diverse labor set that we would hope for many reasons. Similarly, unfortunately, also again for many societal reasons, those who are entering the criminal justice system are not diverse in a different way, which is, they\u2019re disproportionately minority and African-American and I think both of those results are an example of broader societal issues that we\u2019re struggling with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And they are sort of an opportunity for us to really focus on addressing both of those, which is how can we use technology better to understand how to reduce those entering the system.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Addressing the problems of inequity and racial justice in the criminal justice system would allow for more opportunities for communities of color to thrive in many different ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201dThe criminal justice system really embodies a lot of our problems with race in our country,\u201d Zamora says. \u201cSo if we can fix that, I do think we\u2019ll see a lot of positive changes.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><em>Featured image by Bryce Durbin \/ photos by Yashad Kulkarni<\/em><\/span><\/h6>\n<p><img class=\"breakout wow\" src=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/interstitial2.jpg?w=1024\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Chrisfino Kenyatta Leal never thought he would end up in prison, let alone the tech industry.
