How European startups are aiding Ukrainian refugees


Rebecca Bellan Mike Butcher 2 weeks







Thomas Duscha, founder and CEO of Berlin-based battery swapping startup Swobbee, was in Poland visiting family in early March when the reach of the Ukraine crisis galvanized him to action.
“I was just there a few weeks ago with my wife and newborn child, and it was normal, and now suddenly, there’s Black Hawk helicopters and shit is going down there,” he said. “We decided right away we needed to do something.”
In the weeks since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, more than 3 million Ukrainians have fled their country as of Tuesday, according to a tracker from the U.N. refugee agency. Of those, over 1.8 million have landed in Poland. Because Berlin is so close to the Polish border, many in Berlin’s startup scene and beyond have begun a grassroots effort, backed by tech, to provide supplies, ferry passengers across the border and find jobs and homes for refugees.

Duscha started with a post on LinkedIn that put out a call to action among the tech community in Berlin.
“Swobbee will provide mobile energy and Vodafone Gigacubes to ensure that people stay in contact with their loved ones,” read the March 3 post. “I will drive myself with helpers on the 11th of march to my hometown Tomaszów Lubelski to bring what is urgently needed. We are well connected with the mayor whose team knows how and where to help as situation changes from minute to minute.”
Duscha asked followers to donate supplies like baby food, canned goods, diapers, sleeping bags, first aid and menstruation products, medicine, power banks, flashlights and batteries. Then he tagged a number of executives, founders and investors in Berlin’s mobility and startup scene.
“I tagged them and now they can’t escape, they need to help,” he said, noting that he tagged a Tier Mobility executive in one of his posts, who responded immediately saying Tier had 10 tons of goods but no carrier. “Five minutes later, we got a solution for them.”

Swobbee was able to enlist the help of startups like Onomotion, an e-mobility company focusing on urban logistics, and Emmy, an e-moped sharing company that was recently purchased by GoTo Global, to provide vans packed with goods to be sent to the border. The company has even tapped some of its logistics clients to drop supplies off at the border and bring Ukrainian refugees back to Berlin.

On Friday, March 11, a convoy of about 30 people in six vans delivered 5,000 headlamps, 2,000 power banks and loads of other basic daily necessities to the Ukrainian border, said Duscha, noting that his family’s property with cabins nearby had been turned into a base camp for organizers.
“First we visited an orphanage where we had to drop off some stuff then we went to a random city that asked us for help very close to the border as they had power supply shortages, so we also dropped off some power bags and batteries and so on that have been brought directly into Crimea and are now in Kyiv,” said Duscha. “The next day, half of us went back to Germany, picking up people from the borders as the eastern part of Poland is quite crowded already and there’s limited capacity to host people there.”
Duscha said he and the tech community in Berlin use various chat rooms on major communications platforms, like LinkedIn, Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram, to coordinate the transport of goods and people across the borders. He also said that he and everyone in his immediate circle are hosting families in their own homes.
Donate to Duscha’s crowdfunding campaign here.
“I’ve never seen so much solidarity before,” said Duscha. “If it weren’t at war, I’d say this the best thing that happened to the European Union. We’ve been divided by COVID, by nationalistic influences, but now we are unified. I haven’t seen a unified European Union since I’ve been on this planet.”
Duscha and Swobbee are just one example of a broader European startup ecosystem mobilizing to help get supplies to refugees on the ground, transport refugees, find them homes and jobs, raise funds and fight against cyber attacks and disinformation.
Check back in — this list will be regularly updated. Last updated: March 21, 2022.
Supplies on the ground
Ukrainian Defense Fund was created by ex-Uber executive Andrey Liscovich to provide supplies and support to the everyday people fighting on the ground in Ukraine – everything from body armor and tactical first aid kits to thermal underwear, power banks and food. Donate on Venmo through the Manoff Foundation.
Lifesaver and Techfugees are working together to donate and ship thousands of pre-charged power banks to Poland and directly to some Ukrainian cities, including Lviv. This is in order to ensure people on the ground can still use their mobile phones even when power has been cut off by bombing. Donate here.
Sennder, a platform that connects large commercial shippers with small freight carriers, teamed up with other startups to collect donations in Berlin and drive them to the Ukrainian border.
Commerce4good, a charity founded by the teams of startups Viceroy Group and Popup, has established a network of suppliers and on-the-ground volunteers in Ukraine to provide essential needs quickly — things like food for the elderly, radio equipment to civilians and fabrics to producers. Donate here.
Uber published a list of codes that people can use in many Polish cities to get a free ride to deliver goods to Red Cross locations. That promotion was valid until March 6 and for one free ride up to about $7. Uber has not responded to TechCrunch’s request for information as to if and when they would continue the promotion.
Gorillas, a 10-minute grocery delivery company based in Berlin, has been collecting and donating essential items from its Berlin warehouses and delivering them to the Wolne Miejsce Foundation to distribute the products to the border. Customers can order one of the “Help Boxes” on the Gorillas app to be shipped to the border.
A coalition of La French Tech mission, France Digitale and The Galion Project has launched a crowdfunding effort on Leetchi to raise money for supplies for Ukrainian refugees.
Transporting refugees from Ukraine
Techfugees, a U.K.-based nonprofit organization that creates sustainable digital solutions to help displaced people regain their autonomy, has worked double-time to provide a number of resources to Ukrainian refugees, including transportation and relocation options. (Disclaimer: Mike Butcher, TechCrunch’s editor-at-large, is also the co-founder and president of Techfugees.) Donate here.
The organization has coordinated with Citizens of Our Planet, the U.S. foundation behind inbound lead conversion and scheduling app Chili Piper, to create an extensive document that outlines how to get people out of Ukraine, transportation options within Ukraine to the borders, procedures for all neighboring countries that receive refugees and accommodations available.
Bolt, the Estonian startup and app that operates on-demand ride-hailing, shared cars and scooters, and restaurant and grocery delivery, said it would reduce its commission for all services in Ukraine to zero. The company is also incentivizing drivers in Poland and Slovakia to accept rides on the Ukrainian border to help transport refugees. In addition, Bolt is donating 5% of every order in Europe to NGOs like Red Cross and expects to donate up to €5 million within the next week.
Flixbus, the bus transport service under the $3 billion German transportation startup FlixMobility, is offering free tickets for refugees, regardless of nationality. The company created additional connections for people coming to the Ukrainian-Polish border from Przemyśl and Rzeszów in Poland or Bucharest, Romania. FlixBus is also using its fleet and tapping partners to transport goods and supplies to refugees.
Uber has been providing free trips between the Poland-Ukraine border. By choosing the option Uber Aid with the codes POMOCLUBELSKIE or POMOCPODKARPACKIE, people can take rides to and from one of the border crossings and the cities of Lublin or Rzeszów. The codes are valid for two free rides of up to $70 each. While the fine print of the offer says the codes expired on March 12, Uber told TechCrunch that the offers are still ongoing.
Ukrainian ride-hailing company Uklon has continued to operate in Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Kherson and other hot spots. The company launched the option of an “evacuation” trip, allowing users to connect to drivers who could take them to west Ukraine, which helped evacuate thousands of Ukrainians, the company told TechCrunch.
Uklon also launched project “volunteer” giving free rides for up to 50 volunteer groups that are transporting critical workers like doctors and pharmacists, medicine, food and other supplies. As of this week, 2,400 trips were completed, delivering 45,000 portions of food, 2,100 kilograms of fruit and vegetables and 10,000 liters of water.
Ukrainian Software developers Andrii Taganskyi and Eugene Gusarov convinced BlaBlaCar, a carpooling app, and Uklon, the Ukrainian Uber, to organize carpools and rides for civilians fleeing some of the worst conflict zones. The two got BlaBlaCar to turn off its commission fee and send texts to its 17,000 drivers across Ukraine to call for help moving people to safety.
“In the first three days alone, BlaBlaCar ferried more than 50,000 people to the west of Ukraine to safety,” Taganskyi told the Independent, noting that he and Gusarov later worked to get Ukrainian insurance companies on board and sending texts to more than 70,000 bus owners asking them to join BlaBlaCar.
Housing for refugees
Station F, a startup campus in Paris, is offering Ukrainian entrepreneurs who have taken refuge in France free accommodation for their families at Flatmates, a residence for Station F entrepreneurs.
Wunderflats, a platform that helps users in Germany find furnished temporary apartments, is helping Ukrainian refugees find temporary homes. While Wunderflats can’t promise free accommodation, as pricing is at the discretion of those who are providing housing, the company said two thirds of the landlords who registered to help asked for nothing in rent.
People with spare rooms can sign up on We Help Ukraine, a new platform to help Ukrainian refugees in a variety of ways. The platform, which was founded by a truly diverse group of organizations from tech companies to charities to ad agencies, also helps displaced Ukrainians find financial, medical and psychological support, acquire refugee status, find jobs and take local language classes.
EU4UA was formed by the co-founders of Paris-based HRTech startup Jobgether as a platform that matches refugees with people who can offer shelter.
Within Ukraine, some tech-savvy nationals have created websites like Prykhystok, which is described as an Airbnb or Couchsurfing for refugees. Prykhystok is the brainchild of Ukrainian MP Halyna Yanchenko, a mother who is trapped under shelling in Kyiv and separated from her two children after she sent them west for safety, according to The Independent. Yanchenko says the website now has over 5,000 shelters across the country.
Another website, Ukraine Now, will be launching soon to provide an online shelter service that crowdsources information on housing within Ukraine where people can stay on their way out of the country.
There are many other housing initiatives, including one by tech startup Casafari, but there is also Shelter UKR, TakecareBnB, Icanhelp.host and UkraineTakeShelter.com. However, readers are advised to proceed with caution as few sites have come up with a verified way of checking the identities of accommodation hosts.
Tech jobs for Ukrainians
UA Talents is an employment platform that’s just cropped up to help Ukrainians who have been forced to leave their homes find European Union employers. The founding team are all volunteers, IT entrepreneurs and experts from Ukraine who live abroad and want to support the livelihood of refugees and their families.
Jobs4Ukraine is a platform that was also recently set up to help Ukrainians find jobs. The site already has dozens of companies signed up as potential employers. Anyone who wants to volunteer to help with skill-sharing from software development to marketing to translations can also sign up.
Another platform that’s looking to tap the highly skilled Ukrainian workforce is Remote Ukraine, which matches highly trained tech talent to EU businesses. The work can be anything from one-off tasks, short-term contracts or full-time roles. The site also handles payments to make the process seamless. It is a joint venture with Techfugees.
Techfugees is working with U.K. and European VCs to pool funds that can support displaced persons who are able to work remotely to support their families during migration. The organization is set to launch an online platform with Tech Nation U.K. and certain British VCs to form a streamlined process. Techfugees is also forming a collective with pan-European VCs.
While not necessarily related to job hunting, Duolingo is donating all of its ad revenue for those learning to speak Ukrainian to organizations like UNHCR, IRC and others working to help displaced people. Through these partners, the language-learning app will distribute codes for Duolingo Plus so refugees and their hosts can use the premium version for free. The Duolingo English Test is also working with UNHCR and Ukraine Global Scholars to provide waivers to its Access Program so Ukrainian students can take English proficiency tests necessary for university applications.
An IT army
A handful of initiatives have sprung up to help NGOs modernize and digitize their systems so they can better coordinate humanitarian aid. Tech to the Rescue, a platform that matches nonprofits to tech companies for this purpose, recently launched its #TechForUkraine campaign. The initiative aims to get tech savvy individuals helping Ukrainian charities with things like weak security systems, outdated software and a lack of user friendly UI and UX.
Code for Romania, a volunteer organization dedicated to digitizing Romania for the good of civil society and the state, ceased normal activity on February 24 to direct all of its efforts towards a War Task Force. The organization and its community of over 2,700 volunteers is working together to come up with an ecosystem of digital solutions for the Ukraine crisis. It’s working with Romania’s Department of Emergency Situations to provide tools for managing resources and volunteers, and has created a guide with vital information for displaced persons.
Code for Romania’s task force is also working on a solution to direct refugees to safe accommodation and to provide emergency support.
Techfugees developed an open source, fast-response site to map out current conflict areas and safe areas, as well as a fuel map for those who are driving out of the country.
CREOpoint, an AI-driven platform that battles disinformation, fake news and deep fakes, is working to counteract the false data circulating from Russian propaganda machines and otherwise as it relates to the war in Ukraine.
While not a startup, Google is sending air raid alerts to Android phones in Ukraine.
Pledge Ukraine is a powerful tool to help people more quickly find organizations that are asking for donations for different needs in Ukraine, from journalists to legal to government to children. Built by former CTO at safe youth transportation startup HopSkipDrive Sophy Lee and assembled by a team of volunteers, the site shows reputable organizations, provides info on what your donation will accomplish and is very user friendly.
What’s still needed?
“In the countries where the people travel to like, Spain or Germany or the Netherlands, we will need therapists or therapy capacities, people that can handle trauma,” said Duscha. “On Saturday, I met a guy who arrived with his two-month-old baby and six and 10-year-old girls. They were fleeing from Kyiv and they were attacked by Russian military, and his wife was shot and killed in the car. He and his children had to bury his wife by the motorway.”
Therapy platforms like It’s Complicated have offered free online counseling to anyone directly affected by the war in Ukraine. Some Israeli health tech companies have also teamed up to provide emotional help to Ukrainians. Those companies are Kai, an AI-powered personal coach to support mental wellness, Amplio Learning, a platform that helps students with special needs and learning and emotional difficulties, and Femi, a digital medical services company.
Housing will also be crucial as more Ukrainians flee cities that are being attacked by Russian armed forces. On Monday, the first convoy of civilians was able to leave the besieged city of Mariupol since the city was surrounded by the Russian army two weeks ago. Ukrainian authorities have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe there since civilians trapped inside the city are being cut off from deliveries of food and medicine, and there has been relentless fire from Russia which has thwarted attempts for people to fleet. Over 2,000 people have been killed in Mariupol since the fighting began.
Many companies are working together with NGOs and governments to help, but Duscha says the next big step is really coordination, structure and optimization of supply and demand. There needs to be more centralized ways of managing resources, and that will require help from the private sector.

Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in late February, Delfast\u2019s top priority has been to see its Ukrainian team of 30 safely evacuated from the most dangerous parts of the country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n When not focusing on sales, marketing, R&D and customer support, Delfast\u2019s smaller team of seven employees based in Los Angeles has been pleading with U.S. politicians and the European Commission to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and fighter jets that could help Ukraine gain back some control over its air space, and, hopefully, put a stop to this war.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Delfast\u2019s co-founders, Daniel Tonkopi and Serhiy Denysenko, say they have always believed in safeguarding the future. When they founded Delfast in 2014, originally as a delivery company, Tonkoply and Denysenko knew that providing couriers with green transportation options would be critical to the company\u2019s operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n \t \n\t\t \n\t\t\tThe most important thing for an entrepreneur, and in general for any leader, is to protect the team and be completely honest with them during a tough time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Tonkopi, co-founder of Delfast<\/cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/span><\/p>\n The founders soon realized that a bike with the power, range and battery life their couriers needed didn\u2019t exist, and so they set out to build one. In 2017, backed by a Kickstarter campaign that saw the company raise $165,000, the startup began manufacturing a bike to fit its needs \u2013 one that promptly <\/span>won the Guinness Book of World Records<\/span><\/a> for the greatest distance traveled on an electric motorbike on a single charge.<\/span><\/p>\n More recently, the Delfast Top 3.0 e-motorbike <\/span>won Forbes\u2019 fastest e-bike of the year<\/span><\/a> in 2022 after the company announced some serious <\/span>upgrades to the vehicle during CES<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n We spoke with Delfast\u2019s co-founders to discuss what it\u2019s like running a startup during a war, how the startup is considering breaking into new business verticals, and the importance of always having a Plan B.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n Note: Serhiy Denysenko\u2019s answers were translated from Ukrainian by a member of Delfast\u2019s team for TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n TC: Serhiy, you’re on the ground in Kyiv. What’s your day-to-day like?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues. It\u2019s important to keep in touch and know that everyone is fine, or as fine as is possible right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Besides my work as a COO, I\u2019ve been helping with volunteering, getting supplies and medicine to people, and this is something that pretty much every Ukrainian is now doing. I had my family relocated to Hungary, so I feel more or less safe, and I\u2019m just trying to work as much as possible and do my best in every possible area, whether that\u2019s supporting the company or supporting Ukraine in general.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n How are you managing your team through this crisis? What\u2019s changed?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>We got used to working remotely during Coronavirus times, so we have our task tracker, where everyone can see his or her task. Every Monday, we have an online Zoom meeting. Previously we only had these meetings at the executive level, but now during the war, we are gathering all together, just to see each other\u2019s faces and ask how they\u2019re doing, how\u2019s everyone feeling. Just to talk with everybody.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n <\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":" “Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues.

But second, and more immediately relevant in this case, you would not know that there is a technique to it that, surprisingly, robots aren’t super good at because they tend to be… crushy. But this robo-berry<\/a> designed by Swiss researchers could usher in a new era of gentle, automated robo-pickers.<\/p>\n The secret to picking a raspberry is to grip it just enough to get purchase and then pull it downwards off the little stem, apparently called the “receptacle,” which seems backwards. Seems simple \u2014 and it is, but only our hands are among the most sensitive and finely controlled constructions in the universe, the culmination of a hundred million years of evolution, outdone only by (I suspect) raccoons.<\/p>\n Robots simply don’t have the senses necessary to figure out the perfect technique for picking a berry. But what if it could communicate with the berry to better sense the forces involved and avoid either a a brutal crushing or humiliating failure-to-detach?<\/p> <\/div>\n That’s what Kai Junge, a PhD student at EPFL in Switzerland, aims to accomplish with this “sensorized raspberry,” a silicone and silicon replica berry that provides feedback to the picking machine, allowing it to learn to pick faster and better \u2014 and cleaner.<\/p>\n “It\u2019s an exciting dilemma for us as robotics engineers,” said professor Josie Hughes, who worked with Junge on the project. “The raspberry harvesting season is so short, and the fruit is so valuable, that wasting them simply isn’t an option. What’s more, the cost and logistical challenges of testing different options out in the field are prohibitive. That\u2019s why we decided to run our tests in the lab and develop a replica raspberry for training harvesting robots.”<\/p>\n Apparently the hard part comes just at the moment of detaching, when the force needed to grip the berry on the receptacle suddenly becomes overkill as the object goes from solid to hollow.<\/p>\n The replica berry has a fluidic sensor that tells the system how much compression is being experienced by the silicone drooplets, allowing the control model to learn how to adjust its grip as if the berry itself is telling it how much is too much.<\/p>\n You can see the berry in action below:<\/p>\n <\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The team plans to present their work at RobotSoft in April. And once the raspberry question is decided, they may move on to other berries, tomatoes, grapes&#8230; even apricots.

Riley Principal to access over the next few weeks if certain conditions are met, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Swvl was founded by <a href=\"https:\/\/eg.linkedin.com\/in\/mostafa-kandil-57761032\">Mostafa Kandil<\/a>, Mahmoud Nouh and Ahmed Sabbah in 2017. The trio started the company as a bus-hailing service in Egypt and other ride-sharing services in emerging markets with fragmented public transportation.<\/p>\n<p>Its bus-hailing services enable users to make intra-state journeys by booking seats on buses running a fixed route. Swvl offerings have expanded beyond bus-hailing services, though. Now, the company offers inter-city rides, car ride-sharing, and corporate services in the 10 cities it operates in across Africa and the Middle East.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The partnership between Swvl and Queen\u2019s Gambit came from a mutual interest from both parties<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While searching for a company to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acquire<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl fit the blank-check company\u2019s criteria: strong business fundamentals, mobility and logistics (one of its core verticals), and an ESG ethos around women and affordable transportation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl &#8212; off the back of raising over $170 million in venture capital, expanding to over 16 countries across Latin America, Asia and Africa; hiring executives from Facebook, Uber and Optimus; and acquiring Shotl, Viapool and door2door &#8212; was on a quest for global dominance in the mobility space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A SPAC with Queen\u2019s Gambit was the most suitable option for it from a financial standpoint, and both parties feel strongly about the sustainability angle around transport &#8212; Swvl claims it has prevented approximately 289 million pounds of carbon emissions since its inception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company plans to expand into several countries over the next six months, including Colombia, Mexico, South Africa, and the U.S. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, all eyes will be on the company\u2019s performance as it <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">officially<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starts trading tomorrow in a cooling SPAC market and a generally unsettled public market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s a softness in the market, but as long as the company operates and delivers results, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maybe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today, people don\u2019t pay attention to it, but they will in months ahead,\u201d Grace said about the worrying SPAC and public markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the market will change <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like it always does and people go back to fundamentals at how we look at company\u2019s performances. For Swvl, they have been beating every single number that was ever presented to us. And that\u2019s what makes me super excited about this.

But with Minit, the tech giant is doubling down on a software category that could be worth over $11 billion by 2030, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wfmz.com\/news\/pr_newswire\/pr_newswire_technology\/global-process-mining-software-market-size-value-estimated-to-reach-usd-11-096-7-million\/article_a95b3354-ec2f-5389-b761-e4dbbdadbb97.html#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20report%20published,forecast%20period%202022%20to%202030.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according<\/a> to a report from Polaris Market Research.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292372\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear whether the whole of the Minit team will join Microsoft &#8212; or, indeed, whether the company will remain spread across its current locations. (Minit is now headquartered in Amsterdam, with satellite offices in London and New York.) But CEO James Dening said that customers shouldn&#8217;t expect a change in the level of support they&#8217;re currently receiving.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to what it means to become part of an industry leader like Microsoft and what that brings us &#8212; how we can use that scale and excellence to continue to deliver great solutions to our customers,&#8221; Dening wrote in a blog <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minit.io\/blog\/microsoft-minit-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post<\/a> on Minit&#8217;s website. &#8220;It has been a privilege to lead the company for the last year, and I\u2019m excited to continue my journey with the team, as part of what I consider to be the world\u2019s leading software company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Microsoft spokesperson Zara Huang told TechCrunch that the Minit team will move into the\u00a0<span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> Process Insights team and that there will be &#8220;no change&#8221; to the current work location of Minit team members. <span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> is in early stages of determining how Minit will be integrated into its offerings, she said, and the companies will share more details when they&#8217;re available.<\/p>\n<p>Minit, which was founded in 2015 by Rasto Hlavac and had raised \u20ac10.3 million (~$11.40 million) prior to the acquisition, is one of an expanding number of startups developing process mining tools aimed at enterprise clientele. Process mining, also known as task discovery, involves spotting root cause workflow issues and bottlenecks by pulling data from systems including desktop, email apps and workflows. It&#8217;s a key part of robotic process automation (RPA), a technology that promises to automate monotonous, repetitive tasks traditionally performed by human workers while at the same time generating logs to identify potential cost savings.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As Protocol&#8217;s Aisha Counts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/bulletins\/microsoft-process-mining-minit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notes<\/a>, process mining has traditionally been done by system integrators who map out processes by analyzing manual workflows. Process mining software is designed to digitize the approach in a way that reduces the expense, time and effort involved.<\/p>\n<p>Underlining the appetite for process mining technologies, Celonis, a data processing company, earlier this week acquired Minit competitor Process Analytics Factory, which coincidentally integrates with Microsoft&#8217;s Power BI analytics platform. Just in the past several years, RPA vendor Automation Anywhere acquired process discovery and mining startups FortressIQ, Process Gold\\ and StepShot; Blue Prism released a task mining solution called Capture; and rivals including ABBYY and Kryon have expanded their process mining offerings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/\">Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=wqSRCOP7wQ#?secret=2NKiKfcj0k\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;You know the process space is hot when even Microsoft, with its vast resources, has to buy its way in.

SAP acquired German process automation company Signavio in January 2021, just before ServiceNow got into the RPA segment with the buyout of India-based Intellibot.io.

been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robotics-roundup-12\/\">focused on pizza<\/a>. I\u2019ve long posited that this is for two key reasons. First: People like pizza. We eat a lot of it. Americans alone eat three billion pizzas a year. Second: It\u2019s relatively easy to make. The dough provides a fairly straightforward platform onto which ingredients are added.<\/p>\n<p>I say \u201cfairly\u201d here because there are still complications. There\u2019s really no such thing as easy when it comes to building robots that can execute variations on a task at a large scale. Here it\u2019s the dough that presents the problem. Turning a soft and malleable ball of dough into a pizza crust is one of those things humans have figured out how to do efficiently, but it still proves difficult for robot workers.<\/p>\n<p>A team of researchers at MIT, CMU and UC San Diego set out to create what they\u2019ve deemed \u201ccomplex dough-manipulation.\u201d The system is separated into a two-step process, in which the robot must first determine the task and then execute it using a tool like a rolling pin. The system, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2022\/robotic-deformable-object-0331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DiffSkill<\/a>, involves teaching robots complex tasks in simulations.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292473\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>MIT notes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A \u201cteacher\u201d algorithm solves each step the robot must take to complete the task. Then, it trains a \u201cstudent\u201d machine-learning model that learns abstract ideas about when and how to execute each skill it needs during the task, like using a rolling pin. With this knowledge, the system reasons about how to execute the skills to complete the entire task.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The researchers say the system outperformed those trained in the more traditional reinforcement learning model. \u201cOur framework provides a novel way for robots to acquire new skills. These skills can then be chained to solve more complex tasks which are beyond the capability of previous robot systems,\u201d says CSAIL grad student, Yunzhu Li.<\/p>\n<p>This is robotics, so the whole pizza thing is really an initial problem for a system designed to tackle a lot more tasks. The company points to the emerging field of eldercare robotics as a possible use going forward.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A disproportionate number of the early industrial food-making robots we\u2019ve seen have been focused on pizza.

The organization and its community of over 2,700 volunteers is working together to come up with an ecosystem of digital solutions for the Ukraine crisis.

They were fleeing from Kyiv and they were attacked by Russian military, and his wife was shot and killed in the car. He and his children had to bury his wife by the motorway.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Therapy platforms like\u00a0<strong>It&#8217;s Complicated<\/strong> have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.complicated.life\/en\/find-help-with\/therapists-for-ukraine\">offered free online counseling to anyone directly affected by the war in Ukraine<\/a>.

Those companies are\u00a0<strong>Kai<\/strong>, an AI-powered personal coach to support mental wellness,\u00a0<strong>Amplio Learning<\/strong>, a platform that helps students with special needs and learning and emotional difficulties, and\u00a0<strong>Femi<\/strong>, a digital medical services company.<\/p>\n<p>Housing will also be crucial as more Ukrainians flee cities that are being attacked by Russian armed forces. On Monday, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2022\/3\/14\/ukraine-russia-war-mariupol-evacuation-convoy\">the first convoy of civilians was able to leave the besieged city of Mariupol<\/a> since the city was surrounded by the Russian army two weeks ago. Ukrainian authorities have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe there since civilians trapped inside the city are being cut off from deliveries of food and medicine, and there has been relentless fire from Russia which has thwarted attempts for people to fleet. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2022\/3\/12\/russia-ukraine-war-alarm-grows-over-mariupol-liveblog#:~:text=The%20city%20council%20of%20besieged,killing%20at%20least%2035%20people.\">Over 2,000 people have been killed in Mariupol since the fighting began<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Many companies are working together with NGOs and governments to help, but Duscha says the next big step is really coordination, structure and optimization of supply and demand.
