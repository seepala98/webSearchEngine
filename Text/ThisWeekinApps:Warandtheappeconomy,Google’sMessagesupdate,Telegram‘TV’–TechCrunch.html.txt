This Week in Apps: War and the app economy, Google’s Messages update, Telegram ‘TV’


Sarah Perez @sarahintampa / 3 weeks







Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.
The app industry continues to grow, with a record number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the latest year-end reports. Global spending across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China grew 19% in 2021 to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5%, reaching 230 billion in 2021, and mobile ad spend grew 23% year over year to reach $295 billion.
Today’s consumers now spend more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV, in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but in 2021, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.

Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours, either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021, 233 apps and games generated over $100 million in consumer spend, and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue. This was up 20% from 2020, when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend, and just eight apps topped $1 billion.
This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps to try, too.

Russia’s app economy shuts down

As the Russia-Ukraine war continued this week, the app ecosystem also saw further impacts. As businesses pulled out of Russia, the ability for Russian consumers to transact on the app stores and in apps is similarly being impacted. This week, Google announced it was suspending Google Play’s billing system for users in Russia in the “coming days,” which means Russian users won’t be able to purchase apps and games, make subscription payments or conduct any other in-app purchases of digital goods using Google Play in Russia. Free apps will remain available on the Play Store, the company said.
But the app platform themselves don’t necessarily have to shut down payments for Russian users to experience issues with billing and transactions, as some Russian App Store users now are. That’s because this week Visa, Mastercard and American Express all announced they would suspend operations in Russia in protest of its invasion of Ukraine. If App Store or Google Play users had these cards on file, they would have stopped working anyway.
Numerous tech companies, including Apple, Airbnb, Microsoft, Adobe, PayPal, Netflix, Snap and many others have also suspended sales and operations in Russia as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In addition to the humanitarian reasons for their exit, there are other costs — sanctions and complications with payments make it difficult to continue supporting Russian customers regardless.
Google fixes Apple’s messaging issues with app update
Alongside a wider Android update, Google announced new features designed to work around Apple’s decision to continue to support SMS instead of the newer and more modern standard RCS. This week, Google’s Messages app, which comes pre-installed on most Android phones, was updated to address the long-standing issue where iMessage’s “Tapbacks” weren’t delivered as emoji reactions, but were rather sent as a separate message. It’s been an annoyance that’s made chats between Android and iPhone users confusing, cluttered and far too noisy.
After the update, reactions from iPhone users will be sent as an emoji on text messages on Android. As on iMessage, the emoji reaction — like love, laughter, confusion or excitement — will appear on the right side of the message. (On Android, it’s the bottom right.) Android’s interpretation of which emoji to use varies slightly from iPhone, however. For instance, the “heart” reaction on Android becomes the “face with the heart eyes” emoji. And the iMessage’s exclamation mark reaction becomes the “face with the open mouth” emoji. This update is first rolling out to Android devices set to English, but additional languages will follow.

Related to the lack of RCS support, Google also integrated Google Photos into the Messages app to improve the video-sharing experience between iOS and Android users. While people with Android devices can share high-quality videos with each other, those same videos appear blurry when shared with those on iPhone, as iMessage doesn’t support RCS. By sending the link to the video through Google Photos, iPhone users will be able to watch the video in the same high resolution. This feature will later include support for photos, too.
Google thus far has been very vocal about Apple’s decision to avoid supporting RCS — largely because RCS adoption would allow Google to better compete with Apple’s iMessage. But Google is not wrong when it points out that Apple is not serving its own customers very well by having iMessage fall back to the older standard of SMS, which is less secure. (An odd choice for a privacy-focused company like Apple claims to be.) It also leads to an inconsistent messaging experience, where features like typing indicators, read receipts and high-res media sharing don’t work in some chats.
Apple, to some extent, benefits by making SMS the “worse” experience, as this can help with ecosystem lock-in. But critics argue that decisions like this have led to iMessage failing as a global messaging champion, benefitting third-party messaging apps. Users worldwide have turned to other messaging apps in part because Apple chose not to compete on Android, or even keep up with the baseline features for modern-day messaging.
Weekly News

Apple introduced a range of new devices at its “Peek Performance” event this week, including a new iPhone SE with the same A15 Bionic chip as iPhone 13; a new iPad Air with an M1processor; a new M1 Ultra chip and the machine it powers, the Mac Studio; and a new Apple display called the Studio Display.
As a part of that news, Apple noted iOS 15.4 is set to roll out next week. The update brings several new features, including Face ID that works with face masks, Tap to Pay, new AirTag safety features, a new Siri voice, and more. iPadOS 15.4, macOS Monterey 12.3, watchOS 8.5 and tvOS 15.4 will also become available.
Apple informed its developer community that it’s suspending its Apple Search Ads service on the App Store in Russia “until further notice.”

Google launched Android 12L, the version of Android designed for larger-screen devices and foldables. Samsung, Lenovo and Microsoft have committed to rolling out the OS later this year on select devices.
Google rolled out Air Raid Alerts to Android phones in Ukraine, the company announced Thursday. The system leveraged the low latency alert mechanism that was already built for other natural disasters, like earthquake alerts, and relies on information provided by the Ukrainian government.
Google Play Store users in Russia will no longer be able to buy apps, games, IAPs and subscriptions due to payment system disruptions related to Western sanctions on Russian banks, Google said.
Google Assistant and Google Pay can now help Android users pay for their parking, following the latest Android update. With the feature, users can say “Hey Google, pay for parking,” and follow the Assistant’s voice prompts from your phone. The system currently works with parking provider ParkMobile. The feature was part of a larger Android update.
Google said it’s working on a new tool that could help users reclaim around 60% of app storage temporarily by removing parts of the app rather than removing it completely.
Google’s latest Pixel Drop feature release brought Android’s “Night Sight” feature to Snapchat, Live Captions to phone calls, stickers created by your words in Gboard, an Interpreter mode for Live Translate to translate face-to-face conversations and other features.

E-commerce and Food Delivery

Grocery delivery service Instacart rolled out new in-store navigation and live phone support to the shoppers using its platform. The shoppers will be able to view an interactive map that includes item locations, in an initial pilot with 15 retail partners across more than 80 stores in 17 U.S. states and Canada. The live phone support feature will connect shoppers with reps in both the U.S. and international call centers. A new safety toolkit will give shoppers access to tools such as in-app emergency calling, incident reporting and safety alerts within their Shopper app.
Grocery app Buyk, founded by two Russians, furloughed 98% of staff amid Russian sanctions. The company had sizable operations in NY and Chicago.
Food delivery service Uber Eats relaunched its group ordering feature with a new bill splitting option that will allow U.S. users to create a group order where each person pays for their own food.
Twitter expanded its e-commerce efforts with the launch of new mobile storefronts, called Twitter Shops. The feature will allow merchants to feature a catalog of up to 50 items on their Twitter profiles, which users access via an in-app browser.

Fintech

Trading app Robinhood was spotted working on a new Cash Card that promises no monthly fees, in-network ATM fees, overdraft fees or account minimums.
An NYT report details how scams and fraud continue to impact the bank-backed P2P payments app Zelle, but how U.S. banks say returning money to fraud victims is not their responsibility.
Block (the company previously called Square) is facing a probe by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and multiple state AGs over its Cash App’s handling of customer complaints and disputes, among other things.
PayPal suspended its services in Russia, including money transfer service Xoom.

Social

Instagram killed its Boomerang and Hyperlapse mobile apps. The editing apps were removed from the App Store and Google Play as Instagram continues to focus on Reels and other new features. Boomerang features were integrated into the Instagram camera already, however.
Russia prosecutors have asked a court to ban Facebook and Instagram and designate Meta an “extremist organization,” after Reuters reported the comapny had temporarily eased its restrictions for calling for violence against Russian soldiers invading Ukraine. WhatsApp would not be impacted.
Instagram began warning users in-app if they were sharing Russian state media and blocked state media from discovery areas in the app, including the Discovery tab and Reels. The company was already downranking state media. Private accounts in Russia and Ukraine will have their following and follower lists private and their mutual friend lists hidden, as well.
Instagram added tags to posts to help ensure Black and underrepresented creators received credit for their work. Users will be able to tag other creators within their posts to give them more exposure, through the same “tag people” functionality as before, but then select “Show Profile Category” to display the creator’s category, like photographer, stylist and more.

Twitter’s latest update will help users escape its recommendation algorithm. Following increased pressure from regulators for tech companies to provide ways for users to avoid algorithmic recommendation systems, Twitter has added a feature that lets you more easily navigate between its Home and Latest (algorithmic and recent) timelines in the app.
Twitter launched a Tor service in Russia that allows users to bypass the government’s internet blocks that are stifling the flow of information. Twitter’s new Tor service is based on a version of the Enterprise Onion Toolkit (EOTK), a tool designed by cybersecurity researcher Alec Muffett, who announced the news on Twitter.
Facebook updated its Community Help feature to allow Ukrainians to more easily find reliable information from local U.N. agencies and the Red Cross about where to find medical help, how to get assistance and more. The feature will appear for Ukrainian users both in and outside the country across Facebook and will also point to Ukraine’s State Emergency Services information helpline on WhatsApp.
Facebook rolled out new features for Facebook Group admins, including the ability to automatically decline incoming posts with information marked false by fact-checkers. The company said this could help groups cut down on the spread of misinformation. Admins will also be able to temporarily suspend participants they’ve identified as bad actors from posting, commenting, reacting, participating in group chats and more. And they’ll be able to automatically decline member requests based on other criteria, like if they’ve answered the member questions.

Snapchat turned off its heatmap feature in Ukraine as a safety precaution. The app will no longer show snaps taken in specific locations, as this could be a source of information.

Photos

Google Photos’ Portrait Blur feature was already available to Pixel users and Google One subscribers, but is now rolling out to the Photos app on Android. The photo editing tool intelligently blurs the background on photos of people, post-snap.

Messaging

Telegram, an app being heavily utilized amid the Russia-Ukraine war right now, was updated with a download manager that will place a new icon in the Search bar to show files are actively being downloaded; users can then go to the Downloads tab in Search to view, manage, pause and resume all downloads or individual items, as well as adjust a download’s priority. It also introduced a new attachment menu where you can rearrange or remove items in an album while previewing it before sending. And notably, Telegram users can now broadcast from livestreaming tools like OBS Studio and XSplit Broadcaster, turning any Telegram channel into a TV station of sorts. This latter feature is timely, given how livestreams have become an important part of documenting the war. Other tweaks included the rollout of semi-transparent headers and footers on Android, a redesigned login flow on macOS and Android, new t.me pages, and a way to share t.me links to your phone number that opens a chat with you, so you can chat with someone without sharing your phone number with them.

Streaming & Entertainment

Spotify reported 1.5 million subscriber cancellations due to the Russia-Ukraine war. The company also said that prior to the war, it had been trending ahead of its Q1 guidance of adding 8 million total users (with 3 million paying) — an indication that the Joe Rogan controversies had little impact on its business.
TikTok launched a music distribution platform SoundOn, which allows artists to distribute to ByteDance’s platforms, including TikTok globally; music streamer Resso in Brazil, Indonesia and India; and to its video editor app CapCut. The service also distributes to global platforms including Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora, Deezer and Tencent’s Joox.
Amazon suspended access to Prime Video in Russia, in addition to halting shipments in the country.
AppleTV+ will soon stream two exclusive MLB “Friday Night Baseball” games per week across all platforms, in an exclusive deal.
Apple said a new version of iMovie for iPad OS will ship next month.
Walmart partnered with Spotify to offer six months of free streaming to its Walmart+ subscription customers, essentially its answer to Amazon Prime.
TikTok suspended livestreaming and other new content uploads in Russia following the country’s new law that would impose prison sentences for spreading “fake news.”

Dating

Bumble said it’s ceasing operations in Russia and exiting the Belarusian and Russian app stores. The company’s stock was up 41% following the news and its Q4 earnings.

Government & Policy

South Korea approved rules on its app store law targeting Apple and Google. Lawmakers approved detailed rules for the law passed last year, that will now go into effect on March 15. The law bars the app store operators from forcing developers to use a specific payment method, and says operators cannot delay reviews or refuse, restrict, block or delete the registration, renewal or inspection of mobile content with third-party payment methods. Fines will be as high as 2% of average annual revenues from related business practices.
Apple dismissed the findings of a U.K. regulator’s report on mobile ecosystems as being based on “unsubstantiated allegations and hypothetical concerns” from rivals seeking to make “deep changes to the iPhone” for their own commercial gain.

Amazon’s Amp

Amazon’s Clubhouse competitor arrived this week. The retail giant on Tuesday launched a new mobile app called Amp, which allows people to create live “radio shows” where they can act as a DJ by taking callers and playing tracks from its catalog of tens of millions of licensed songs, ranging from classic titles to today’s music.
While most Clubhouse rivals have focused on talk — like live podcasts — Amazon’s Amp differentiates itself by providing access out of the gate to a broad music catalog. That means Amp users can play DJ, streaming and chatting about their favorite songs and artists to establish themselves as a creator. Or they can use the app to talk about anything else — like sports or pop culture, for example — but do so while also curating a selection of music for their listeners and taking live callers.
The app will also feature shows from Nicki Minaj, Pusha T, singer-songwriter Tinashe, electronic artist and violinist Lindsey Stirling, Travis Barker, Lil Yachty and Big Boi; well-known personalities Tefi Pessoa and Nikita Dragun; popular radio hosts Zach Sang, Kat Corbett, Christian James Hand, and Guy Raz; and writers from music and culture publication The FADER.
The app is available in a limited U.S. beta, and users will need to seek out an invite to get in.
Substack for iOS

Subscription newsletter platform Substack announced this week it’s launching a dedicated app on iOS for reading that organizes all your Substrack email newsletter subscriptions in one place. Substack writers, meanwhile, will benefit if their readers install the app, as they’ll get reliable delivery of their publications and their other media in one place. Users can also choose to turn off emails (!!!) if they want to get the publications just inside the app. The company said it’s working to develop more features to better support podcasters, videomakers, community leaders and more in addition to readers and writers. The company previously introduced a Substack Reader on the web, which offered a similar way to organize and aggregate all your subscriptions in one place; now that offering is mobile.
The app, however, has a bit of Google Reader-like vibe to it, in the sense that it’s allowing a user to build out a reading list of their favorite publications. But while Reader was built on open standards, like RSS, Substack is trying to lock you inside their world — one which increasingly feels like a publisher’s own content platform.
Plus, Substack readers didn’t necessarily need a dedicated app to read their newsletters outside of their inbox — plenty of reading apps, from RSS readers like Feedly to new startups like Matter, allow for this functionality, too.

Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in late February, Delfast\u2019s top priority has been to see its Ukrainian team of 30 safely evacuated from the most dangerous parts of the country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n When not focusing on sales, marketing, R&D and customer support, Delfast\u2019s smaller team of seven employees based in Los Angeles has been pleading with U.S. politicians and the European Commission to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and fighter jets that could help Ukraine gain back some control over its air space, and, hopefully, put a stop to this war.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Delfast\u2019s co-founders, Daniel Tonkopi and Serhiy Denysenko, say they have always believed in safeguarding the future. When they founded Delfast in 2014, originally as a delivery company, Tonkoply and Denysenko knew that providing couriers with green transportation options would be critical to the company\u2019s operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n \t \n\t\t \n\t\t\tThe most important thing for an entrepreneur, and in general for any leader, is to protect the team and be completely honest with them during a tough time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Tonkopi, co-founder of Delfast<\/cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/span><\/p>\n The founders soon realized that a bike with the power, range and battery life their couriers needed didn\u2019t exist, and so they set out to build one. In 2017, backed by a Kickstarter campaign that saw the company raise $165,000, the startup began manufacturing a bike to fit its needs \u2013 one that promptly <\/span>won the Guinness Book of World Records<\/span><\/a> for the greatest distance traveled on an electric motorbike on a single charge.<\/span><\/p>\n More recently, the Delfast Top 3.0 e-motorbike <\/span>won Forbes\u2019 fastest e-bike of the year<\/span><\/a> in 2022 after the company announced some serious <\/span>upgrades to the vehicle during CES<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n We spoke with Delfast\u2019s co-founders to discuss what it\u2019s like running a startup during a war, how the startup is considering breaking into new business verticals, and the importance of always having a Plan B.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n Note: Serhiy Denysenko\u2019s answers were translated from Ukrainian by a member of Delfast\u2019s team for TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n TC: Serhiy, you’re on the ground in Kyiv. What’s your day-to-day like?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues. It\u2019s important to keep in touch and know that everyone is fine, or as fine as is possible right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Besides my work as a COO, I\u2019ve been helping with volunteering, getting supplies and medicine to people, and this is something that pretty much every Ukrainian is now doing. I had my family relocated to Hungary, so I feel more or less safe, and I\u2019m just trying to work as much as possible and do my best in every possible area, whether that\u2019s supporting the company or supporting Ukraine in general.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n How are you managing your team through this crisis? What\u2019s changed?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>We got used to working remotely during Coronavirus times, so we have our task tracker, where everyone can see his or her task. Every Monday, we have an online Zoom meeting. Previously we only had these meetings at the executive level, but now during the war, we are gathering all together, just to see each other\u2019s faces and ask how they\u2019re doing, how\u2019s everyone feeling. Just to talk with everybody.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n <\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":" “Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues.

But second, and more immediately relevant in this case, you would not know that there is a technique to it that, surprisingly, robots aren’t super good at because they tend to be… crushy. But this robo-berry<\/a> designed by Swiss researchers could usher in a new era of gentle, automated robo-pickers.<\/p>\n The secret to picking a raspberry is to grip it just enough to get purchase and then pull it downwards off the little stem, apparently called the “receptacle,” which seems backwards. Seems simple \u2014 and it is, but only our hands are among the most sensitive and finely controlled constructions in the universe, the culmination of a hundred million years of evolution, outdone only by (I suspect) raccoons.<\/p>\n Robots simply don’t have the senses necessary to figure out the perfect technique for picking a berry. But what if it could communicate with the berry to better sense the forces involved and avoid either a a brutal crushing or humiliating failure-to-detach?<\/p> <\/div>\n That’s what Kai Junge, a PhD student at EPFL in Switzerland, aims to accomplish with this “sensorized raspberry,” a silicone and silicon replica berry that provides feedback to the picking machine, allowing it to learn to pick faster and better \u2014 and cleaner.<\/p>\n “It\u2019s an exciting dilemma for us as robotics engineers,” said professor Josie Hughes, who worked with Junge on the project. “The raspberry harvesting season is so short, and the fruit is so valuable, that wasting them simply isn’t an option. What’s more, the cost and logistical challenges of testing different options out in the field are prohibitive. That\u2019s why we decided to run our tests in the lab and develop a replica raspberry for training harvesting robots.”<\/p>\n Apparently the hard part comes just at the moment of detaching, when the force needed to grip the berry on the receptacle suddenly becomes overkill as the object goes from solid to hollow.<\/p>\n The replica berry has a fluidic sensor that tells the system how much compression is being experienced by the silicone drooplets, allowing the control model to learn how to adjust its grip as if the berry itself is telling it how much is too much.<\/p>\n You can see the berry in action below:<\/p>\n <\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The team plans to present their work at RobotSoft in April. And once the raspberry question is decided, they may move on to other berries, tomatoes, grapes&#8230; even apricots.

acquired <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minit.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minit<\/a>, a Bratislava, Slovakia-originated process mining technology vendor, for an undisclosed sum, the companies announced today. Microsoft says that the purchase will &#8220;further empower&#8221; it to &#8220;help &#8230; customers digitally transform&#8221; by creating a more complete picture of their processes &#8212; and identifying which of those processes are ripe for automation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Minit currently enables businesses to transform the way they analyze, monitor and optimize their processes. Minit\u2019s solutions have helped businesses gain deep insights into how processes run, uncover root causes of operational challenges and help mitigate undesired process outcomes,&#8221; Justin Graham, Microsoft&#8217;s general manager of process insights, wrote in a <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.microsoft.com\/blog\/2022\/03\/31\/microsoft-acquires-minit-to-strengthen-process-mining-capabilities\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post<\/a> on Microsoft&#8217;s corporate blog. &#8220;[With Minit, our] customers will be able to better understand their process data, uncover what operations look like in reality, and drive process standardization and improvement across the entire organization to ensure compliance at every step.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft dipped its toes into process mining with the launch of new features in Power Automate in 2019 and the acquisition of Softomotive, an RPA software provider, a year later. But with Minit, the tech giant is doubling down on a software category that could be worth over $11 billion by 2030, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wfmz.com\/news\/pr_newswire\/pr_newswire_technology\/global-process-mining-software-market-size-value-estimated-to-reach-usd-11-096-7-million\/article_a95b3354-ec2f-5389-b761-e4dbbdadbb97.html#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20report%20published,forecast%20period%202022%20to%202030.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according<\/a> to a report from Polaris Market Research.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292372\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear whether the whole of the Minit team will join Microsoft &#8212; or, indeed, whether the company will remain spread across its current locations. (Minit is now headquartered in Amsterdam, with satellite offices in London and New York.) But CEO James Dening said that customers shouldn&#8217;t expect a change in the level of support they&#8217;re currently receiving.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to what it means to become part of an industry leader like Microsoft and what that brings us &#8212; how we can use that scale and excellence to continue to deliver great solutions to our customers,&#8221; Dening wrote in a blog <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minit.io\/blog\/microsoft-minit-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post<\/a> on Minit&#8217;s website. &#8220;It has been a privilege to lead the company for the last year, and I\u2019m excited to continue my journey with the team, as part of what I consider to be the world\u2019s leading software company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Microsoft spokesperson Zara Huang told TechCrunch that the Minit team will move into the\u00a0<span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> Process Insights team and that there will be &#8220;no change&#8221; to the current work location of Minit team members. <span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> is in early stages of determining how Minit will be integrated into its offerings, she said, and the companies will share more details when they&#8217;re available.<\/p>\n<p>Minit, which was founded in 2015 by Rasto Hlavac and had raised \u20ac10.3 million (~$11.40 million) prior to the acquisition, is one of an expanding number of startups developing process mining tools aimed at enterprise clientele. Process mining, also known as task discovery, involves spotting root cause workflow issues and bottlenecks by pulling data from systems including desktop, email apps and workflows. It&#8217;s a key part of robotic process automation (RPA), a technology that promises to automate monotonous, repetitive tasks traditionally performed by human workers while at the same time generating logs to identify potential cost savings.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As Protocol&#8217;s Aisha Counts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/bulletins\/microsoft-process-mining-minit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notes<\/a>, process mining has traditionally been done by system integrators who map out processes by analyzing manual workflows. Process mining software is designed to digitize the approach in a way that reduces the expense, time and effort involved.<\/p>\n<p>Underlining the appetite for process mining technologies, Celonis, a data processing company, earlier this week acquired Minit competitor Process Analytics Factory, which coincidentally integrates with Microsoft&#8217;s Power BI analytics platform. Just in the past several years, RPA vendor Automation Anywhere acquired process discovery and mining startups FortressIQ, Process Gold\\ and StepShot; Blue Prism released a task mining solution called Capture; and rivals including ABBYY and Kryon have expanded their process mining offerings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/\">Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=wqSRCOP7wQ#?secret=2NKiKfcj0k\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;You know the process space is hot when even Microsoft, with its vast resources, has to buy its way in.

been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robotics-roundup-12\/\">focused on pizza<\/a>. I\u2019ve long posited that this is for two key reasons. First: People like pizza. We eat a lot of it. Americans alone eat three billion pizzas a year. Second: It\u2019s relatively easy to make. The dough provides a fairly straightforward platform onto which ingredients are added.<\/p>\n<p>I say \u201cfairly\u201d here because there are still complications. There\u2019s really no such thing as easy when it comes to building robots that can execute variations on a task at a large scale. Here it\u2019s the dough that presents the problem. Turning a soft and malleable ball of dough into a pizza crust is one of those things humans have figured out how to do efficiently, but it still proves difficult for robot workers.<\/p>\n<p>A team of researchers at MIT, CMU and UC San Diego set out to create what they\u2019ve deemed \u201ccomplex dough-manipulation.\u201d The system is separated into a two-step process, in which the robot must first determine the task and then execute it using a tool like a rolling pin. The system, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2022\/robotic-deformable-object-0331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DiffSkill<\/a>, involves teaching robots complex tasks in simulations.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292473\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>MIT notes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A \u201cteacher\u201d algorithm solves each step the robot must take to complete the task. Then, it trains a \u201cstudent\u201d machine-learning model that learns abstract ideas about when and how to execute each skill it needs during the task, like using a rolling pin. With this knowledge, the system reasons about how to execute the skills to complete the entire task.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The researchers say the system outperformed those trained in the more traditional reinforcement learning model. \u201cOur framework provides a novel way for robots to acquire new skills. These skills can then be chained to solve more complex tasks which are beyond the capability of previous robot systems,\u201d says CSAIL grad student, Yunzhu Li.<\/p>\n<p>This is robotics, so the whole pizza thing is really an initial problem for a system designed to tackle a lot more tasks. The company points to the emerging field of eldercare robotics as a possible use going forward.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A disproportionate number of the early industrial food-making robots we\u2019ve seen have been focused on pizza.

As businesses pulled out of Russia, the ability for Russian consumers to transact on the app stores and in apps is similarly being impacted. This week, Google <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/googleplay\/android-developer\/answer\/11950272?hl=en\">announced<\/a> it was suspending Google Play&#8217;s billing system for users in Russia in the &#8220;coming days,&#8221; which means Russian users won&#8217;t be able to purchase apps and games, make subscription payments or conduct any other in-app purchases of digital goods using Google Play in Russia. Free apps will remain available on the Play Store, the company said.<\/p>\n<p>But the app platform themselves don&#8217;t necessarily have to shut down payments for Russian users to experience issues with billing and transactions, as some <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/22\/03\/10\/app-store-purchases-may-have-been-turned-off-in-russia?utm_medium=rss\">Russian App Store<\/a> users now are. That&#8217;s because this week <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-60637429\">Visa, Mastercard and American Express all announced<\/a> they would suspend operations in Russia in protest of its invasion of Ukraine. If App Store or Google Play users had these cards on file, they would have stopped working anyway.<\/p>\n<p>Numerous tech companies, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/01\/apple-halts-product-sales-in-russia-following-ukraine-invasion\/\">Apple<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/04\/airbnb-suspends-all-operations-in-russia-and-belarus\/\">Airbnb<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/04\/google-microsoft-sales-pause-russia\/\">Microsoft<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/07\/netflix-paypal-adobe-and-others-join-tech-companies-suspending-business-in-russia\/\">Adobe, PayPal, Netflix, Snap and many others<\/a> have also suspended sales and operations in Russia as a result of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine. In addition to the humanitarian reasons for their exit, there are other costs &#8212; sanctions and complications with payments make it difficult to continue supporting Russian customers regardless.<\/p>\n<h3>Google fixes Apple&#8217;s messaging issues with app update<\/h3>\n<p>Alongside a wider Android update, Google announced new features designed to work around Apple&#8217;s decision to continue to support SMS instead of the newer and more modern standard RCS. This week, Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/messages.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Messages app<\/a>, which comes pre-installed on most Android phones, was updated to address the long-standing issue where iMessage&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT206894\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tapbacks<\/a>&#8221; weren&#8217;t delivered as emoji reactions, but were rather sent as a separate message. It&#8217;s been an annoyance that&#8217;s made chats between Android and iPhone users confusing, cluttered and far too noisy.<\/p>\n<p>After the update, reactions from iPhone users will be sent as an emoji on text messages on Android. As on iMessage, the emoji reaction &#8212; like love, laughter, confusion or excitement &#8212; will appear on the right side of the message. (On Android, it&#8217;s the bottom right.) Android&#8217;s interpretation of which emoji to use varies slightly from iPhone, however. For instance, the &#8220;heart&#8221; reaction on Android becomes the &#8220;face with the heart eyes&#8221; emoji. And the iMessage&#8217;s exclamation mark reaction becomes the &#8220;face with the open mouth&#8221; emoji. This update is first rolling out to Android devices set to English, but additional languages will follow.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2282503\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2282503\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2282503\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-messsages-1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"678\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-messsages-1.jpg 1418w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-messsages-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-messsages-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-messsages-1.jpg?resize=768,766 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-messsages-1.jpg?resize=680,678 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-messsages-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-messsages-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-messsages-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-messsages-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/google-messsages-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2282503\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Related to the lack of RCS support, Google also integrated Google Photos into the Messages app to improve the video-sharing experience between iOS and Android users. While people with Android devices can share high-quality videos with each other, those same videos appear blurry when shared with those on iPhone, as iMessage doesn&#8217;t support RCS. By sending the link to the video through Google Photos, iPhone users will be able to watch the video in the same high resolution. This feature will later include support for photos, too.<\/p>\n<p>Google thus far has been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/googles-rcs-drama-with-apple-explained\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">very vocal<\/a> about Apple&#8217;s decision to avoid supporting RCS &#8212; largely because RCS adoption would allow Google to better compete with Apple&#8217;s iMessage. But Google is not wrong when it points out that Apple is not serving its own customers very well by having iMessage fall back to the older standard of SMS, which is less secure. (An odd choice for a privacy-focused company like Apple claims to be.) It also leads to an inconsistent messaging experience, where features like typing indicators, read receipts and high-res media sharing don&#8217;t work in some chats.<\/p>\n<p>Apple, to some extent, benefits by making SMS the &#8220;worse&#8221; experience, as this can help with ecosystem <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/why-apples-imessage-is-winning-teens-dread-the-green-text-bubble-11641618009\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lock-in.<\/a> But critics argue that decisions like this have led to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macworld.com\/article\/606152\/imessage-green-bubbles-sms-rcs-reactions.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iMessage failing<\/a> as a global messaging champion, benefitting third-party messaging apps. Users worldwide have turned to other messaging apps in part because Apple chose not to compete on Android, or even keep up with the baseline features for modern-day messaging.<\/p>\n<h1>Weekly News<\/h1>\n<h3>Platforms: Apple<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2281508\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2281508\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2281508\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-iphone-se.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Apple iPhone SE 2022\" width=\"680\" height=\"382\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-iphone-se.jpg 1554w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-iphone-se.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-iphone-se.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-iphone-se.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-iphone-se.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-iphone-se.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-iphone-se.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2281508\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apple <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/08\/apple-peek-performance-event-recap\/\">introduced<\/a> a range of new devices at its &#8220;Peek Performance&#8221; event this week,<\/strong>\u00a0including a new iPhone SE with the same A15 Bionic chip as iPhone 13; a new iPad Air with an M1processor; a new M1 Ultra chip and the machine it powers, the Mac Studio; and a new Apple display called the Studio Display.<\/li>\n<li><strong>As a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2022\/03\/apple-introduces-gorgeous-new-green-finishes-for-the-iphone-13-lineup\/\">part<\/a> of that news, Apple noted iOS 15.4 is set to roll out next week.<\/strong> The update brings several new features, including Face ID that works with face masks, Tap to Pay, new AirTag safety features, a new Siri voice, and more. iPadOS 15.4, macOS Monterey 12.3, watchOS 8.5 and tvOS 15.4 will <a href=\"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2022\/03\/08\/apple-releasing-ios-15-4-macos-12-3-and-other-updates-next-week\/\">also<\/a> become available.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Apple <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/07\/apple-suspends-search-ads-on-the-russian-app-store-until-further-notice\/\">informed<\/a> its developer community that it\u2019s suspending its Apple Search Ads service on the App Store in Russia<\/strong> &#8220;until further notice.&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Platforms: Google<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2225071\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2225071\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2225071\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Untitled-6.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Untitled-6.png 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Untitled-6.png?resize=150,80 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Untitled-6.png?resize=300,159 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Untitled-6.png?resize=768,407 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Untitled-6.png?resize=680,360 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Untitled-6.png?resize=1536,814 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Untitled-6.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2225071\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/07\/googles-android-12l-officially-launches-will-come-to-select-devices-this-year\/\">launched<\/a> Android 12L,<\/strong> the version of Android designed for larger-screen devices and foldables.

But while Reader was built on open standards, like RSS, Substack is trying to lock you inside their world &#8212; one which increasingly feels like a publisher&#8217;s own content platform.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, Substack readers didn&#8217;t necessarily need a dedicated app to read their newsletters outside of their inbox &#8212; plenty of reading apps, from RSS readers like <a href=\"https:\/\/feedly.com\/\">Feedly<\/a> to new startups like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/06\/matter-raises-7-million-series-a-to-build-a-better-reading-app\/\">Matter<\/a>, allow for this functionality, too.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/this-week-in-apps\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1952542\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"93\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png 2047w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=150,21 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=300,41 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=768,105 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=680,93 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=1536,210 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=50,7 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome back to This Week in Apps,\u00a0the weekly TechCrunch series\u00a0that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.
