Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in late February, Delfast\u2019s top priority has been to see its Ukrainian team of 30 safely evacuated from the most dangerous parts of the country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n When not focusing on sales, marketing, R&D and customer support, Delfast\u2019s smaller team of seven employees based in Los Angeles has been pleading with U.S. politicians and the European Commission to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and fighter jets that could help Ukraine gain back some control over its air space, and, hopefully, put a stop to this war.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Delfast\u2019s co-founders, Daniel Tonkopi and Serhiy Denysenko, say they have always believed in safeguarding the future. When they founded Delfast in 2014, originally as a delivery company, Tonkoply and Denysenko knew that providing couriers with green transportation options would be critical to the company\u2019s operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n \t \n\t\t \n\t\t\tThe most important thing for an entrepreneur, and in general for any leader, is to protect the team and be completely honest with them during a tough time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Tonkopi, co-founder of Delfast<\/cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/span><\/p>\n The founders soon realized that a bike with the power, range and battery life their couriers needed didn\u2019t exist, and so they set out to build one. In 2017, backed by a Kickstarter campaign that saw the company raise $165,000, the startup began manufacturing a bike to fit its needs \u2013 one that promptly <\/span>won the Guinness Book of World Records<\/span><\/a> for the greatest distance traveled on an electric motorbike on a single charge.<\/span><\/p>\n More recently, the Delfast Top 3.0 e-motorbike <\/span>won Forbes\u2019 fastest e-bike of the year<\/span><\/a> in 2022 after the company announced some serious <\/span>upgrades to the vehicle during CES<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n We spoke with Delfast\u2019s co-founders to discuss what it\u2019s like running a startup during a war, how the startup is considering breaking into new business verticals, and the importance of always having a Plan B.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n Note: Serhiy Denysenko\u2019s answers were translated from Ukrainian by a member of Delfast\u2019s team for TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n TC: Serhiy, you’re on the ground in Kyiv. What’s your day-to-day like?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues. It\u2019s important to keep in touch and know that everyone is fine, or as fine as is possible right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Besides my work as a COO, I\u2019ve been helping with volunteering, getting supplies and medicine to people, and this is something that pretty much every Ukrainian is now doing. I had my family relocated to Hungary, so I feel more or less safe, and I\u2019m just trying to work as much as possible and do my best in every possible area, whether that\u2019s supporting the company or supporting Ukraine in general.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n How are you managing your team through this crisis? What\u2019s changed?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>We got used to working remotely during Coronavirus times, so we have our task tracker, where everyone can see his or her task. Every Monday, we have an online Zoom meeting. Previously we only had these meetings at the executive level, but now during the war, we are gathering all together, just to see each other\u2019s faces and ask how they\u2019re doing, how\u2019s everyone feeling. Just to talk with everybody.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n <\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":" “Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues.

But second, and more immediately relevant in this case, you would not know that there is a technique to it that, surprisingly, robots aren’t super good at because they tend to be… crushy. But this robo-berry<\/a> designed by Swiss researchers could usher in a new era of gentle, automated robo-pickers.<\/p>\n The secret to picking a raspberry is to grip it just enough to get purchase and then pull it downwards off the little stem, apparently called the “receptacle,” which seems backwards. Seems simple \u2014 and it is, but only our hands are among the most sensitive and finely controlled constructions in the universe, the culmination of a hundred million years of evolution, outdone only by (I suspect) raccoons.<\/p>\n Robots simply don’t have the senses necessary to figure out the perfect technique for picking a berry. But what if it could communicate with the berry to better sense the forces involved and avoid either a a brutal crushing or humiliating failure-to-detach?<\/p> <\/div>\n That’s what Kai Junge, a PhD student at EPFL in Switzerland, aims to accomplish with this “sensorized raspberry,” a silicone and silicon replica berry that provides feedback to the picking machine, allowing it to learn to pick faster and better \u2014 and cleaner.<\/p>\n “It\u2019s an exciting dilemma for us as robotics engineers,” said professor Josie Hughes, who worked with Junge on the project. “The raspberry harvesting season is so short, and the fruit is so valuable, that wasting them simply isn’t an option. What’s more, the cost and logistical challenges of testing different options out in the field are prohibitive. That\u2019s why we decided to run our tests in the lab and develop a replica raspberry for training harvesting robots.”<\/p>\n Apparently the hard part comes just at the moment of detaching, when the force needed to grip the berry on the receptacle suddenly becomes overkill as the object goes from solid to hollow.<\/p>\n The replica berry has a fluidic sensor that tells the system how much compression is being experienced by the silicone drooplets, allowing the control model to learn how to adjust its grip as if the berry itself is telling it how much is too much.<\/p>\n You can see the berry in action below:<\/p>\n <\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The team plans to present their work at RobotSoft in April. And once the raspberry question is decided, they may move on to other berries, tomatoes, grapes&#8230; even apricots.

It\u2019s a usual occurrence &#8212; for instance, when BuzzFeed went public last December, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/buzzfeed-suffers-wave-of-spac-investor-withdrawals-before-going-public-11638472756\">94% of the $287.5 million raised by the SPAC <\/a><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/buzzfeed-suffers-wave-of-spac-investor-withdrawals-before-going-public-11638472756\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was withdrawn<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212; particularly as the SPAC hype gives way in the face of an underperforming market and tighter regulation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the seeming setback, there\u2019s good news for Swvl. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to CFO Youssef Salem, the company has an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">additional $600 million from proceeds and<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> committed equity facility with B. Riley Principal to access over the next few weeks if certain conditions are met, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Swvl was founded by <a href=\"https:\/\/eg.linkedin.com\/in\/mostafa-kandil-57761032\">Mostafa Kandil<\/a>, Mahmoud Nouh and Ahmed Sabbah in 2017. The trio started the company as a bus-hailing service in Egypt and other ride-sharing services in emerging markets with fragmented public transportation.<\/p>\n<p>Its bus-hailing services enable users to make intra-state journeys by booking seats on buses running a fixed route. Swvl offerings have expanded beyond bus-hailing services, though. Now, the company offers inter-city rides, car ride-sharing, and corporate services in the 10 cities it operates in across Africa and the Middle East.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The partnership between Swvl and Queen\u2019s Gambit came from a mutual interest from both parties<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While searching for a company to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acquire<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl fit the blank-check company\u2019s criteria: strong business fundamentals, mobility and logistics (one of its core verticals), and an ESG ethos around women and affordable transportation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl &#8212; off the back of raising over $170 million in venture capital, expanding to over 16 countries across Latin America, Asia and Africa; hiring executives from Facebook, Uber and Optimus; and acquiring Shotl, Viapool and door2door &#8212; was on a quest for global dominance in the mobility space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A SPAC with Queen\u2019s Gambit was the most suitable option for it from a financial standpoint, and both parties feel strongly about the sustainability angle around transport &#8212; Swvl claims it has prevented approximately 289 million pounds of carbon emissions since its inception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company plans to expand into several countries over the next six months, including Colombia, Mexico, South Africa, and the U.S. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, all eyes will be on the company\u2019s performance as it <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">officially<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starts trading tomorrow in a cooling SPAC market and a generally unsettled public market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s a softness in the market, but as long as the company operates and delivers results, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maybe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today, people don\u2019t pay attention to it, but they will in months ahead,\u201d Grace said about the worrying SPAC and public markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the market will change <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like it always does and people go back to fundamentals at how we look at company\u2019s performances. For Swvl, they have been beating every single number that was ever presented to us. And that\u2019s what makes me super excited about this.

But with Minit, the tech giant is doubling down on a software category that could be worth over $11 billion by 2030, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wfmz.com\/news\/pr_newswire\/pr_newswire_technology\/global-process-mining-software-market-size-value-estimated-to-reach-usd-11-096-7-million\/article_a95b3354-ec2f-5389-b761-e4dbbdadbb97.html#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20report%20published,forecast%20period%202022%20to%202030.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according<\/a> to a report from Polaris Market Research.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292372\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear whether the whole of the Minit team will join Microsoft &#8212; or, indeed, whether the company will remain spread across its current locations. (Minit is now headquartered in Amsterdam, with satellite offices in London and New York.) But CEO James Dening said that customers shouldn&#8217;t expect a change in the level of support they&#8217;re currently receiving.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to what it means to become part of an industry leader like Microsoft and what that brings us &#8212; how we can use that scale and excellence to continue to deliver great solutions to our customers,&#8221; Dening wrote in a blog <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minit.io\/blog\/microsoft-minit-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post<\/a> on Minit&#8217;s website. &#8220;It has been a privilege to lead the company for the last year, and I\u2019m excited to continue my journey with the team, as part of what I consider to be the world\u2019s leading software company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Microsoft spokesperson Zara Huang told TechCrunch that the Minit team will move into the\u00a0<span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> Process Insights team and that there will be &#8220;no change&#8221; to the current work location of Minit team members. <span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> is in early stages of determining how Minit will be integrated into its offerings, she said, and the companies will share more details when they&#8217;re available.<\/p>\n<p>Minit, which was founded in 2015 by Rasto Hlavac and had raised \u20ac10.3 million (~$11.40 million) prior to the acquisition, is one of an expanding number of startups developing process mining tools aimed at enterprise clientele. Process mining, also known as task discovery, involves spotting root cause workflow issues and bottlenecks by pulling data from systems including desktop, email apps and workflows. It&#8217;s a key part of robotic process automation (RPA), a technology that promises to automate monotonous, repetitive tasks traditionally performed by human workers while at the same time generating logs to identify potential cost savings.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As Protocol&#8217;s Aisha Counts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/bulletins\/microsoft-process-mining-minit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notes<\/a>, process mining has traditionally been done by system integrators who map out processes by analyzing manual workflows. Process mining software is designed to digitize the approach in a way that reduces the expense, time and effort involved.<\/p>\n<p>Underlining the appetite for process mining technologies, Celonis, a data processing company, earlier this week acquired Minit competitor Process Analytics Factory, which coincidentally integrates with Microsoft&#8217;s Power BI analytics platform. Just in the past several years, RPA vendor Automation Anywhere acquired process discovery and mining startups FortressIQ, Process Gold\\ and StepShot; Blue Prism released a task mining solution called Capture; and rivals including ABBYY and Kryon have expanded their process mining offerings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/\">Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=wqSRCOP7wQ#?secret=2NKiKfcj0k\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;You know the process space is hot when even Microsoft, with its vast resources, has to buy its way in.

SAP acquired German process automation company Signavio in January 2021, just before ServiceNow got into the RPA segment with the buyout of India-based Intellibot.io.

been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robotics-roundup-12\/\">focused on pizza<\/a>. I\u2019ve long posited that this is for two key reasons. First: People like pizza. We eat a lot of it. Americans alone eat three billion pizzas a year. Second: It\u2019s relatively easy to make. The dough provides a fairly straightforward platform onto which ingredients are added.<\/p>\n<p>I say \u201cfairly\u201d here because there are still complications. There\u2019s really no such thing as easy when it comes to building robots that can execute variations on a task at a large scale. Here it\u2019s the dough that presents the problem. Turning a soft and malleable ball of dough into a pizza crust is one of those things humans have figured out how to do efficiently, but it still proves difficult for robot workers.<\/p>\n<p>A team of researchers at MIT, CMU and UC San Diego set out to create what they\u2019ve deemed \u201ccomplex dough-manipulation.\u201d The system is separated into a two-step process, in which the robot must first determine the task and then execute it using a tool like a rolling pin. The system, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2022\/robotic-deformable-object-0331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DiffSkill<\/a>, involves teaching robots complex tasks in simulations.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292473\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>MIT notes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A \u201cteacher\u201d algorithm solves each step the robot must take to complete the task. Then, it trains a \u201cstudent\u201d machine-learning model that learns abstract ideas about when and how to execute each skill it needs during the task, like using a rolling pin. With this knowledge, the system reasons about how to execute the skills to complete the entire task.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The researchers say the system outperformed those trained in the more traditional reinforcement learning model. \u201cOur framework provides a novel way for robots to acquire new skills. These skills can then be chained to solve more complex tasks which are beyond the capability of previous robot systems,\u201d says CSAIL grad student, Yunzhu Li.<\/p>\n<p>This is robotics, so the whole pizza thing is really an initial problem for a system designed to tackle a lot more tasks. The company points to the emerging field of eldercare robotics as a possible use going forward.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A disproportionate number of the early industrial food-making robots we\u2019ve seen have been focused on pizza.

rel=\"noopener\">Deepki<\/a> has raised a $166 million Series C funding round (\u20ac150 million). The company is building a software-as-a-service platform for the real estate industry. It\u2019s a monitoring and analytics product that helps you take better decisions.<\/p>\n<p>Companies using Deepki can track and analyze ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria, starting with carbon emissions generated by their real estate portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t reduce what you can\u2019t measure. As real estate investors want to lower their environmental impact with new and existing projects, Deepki first lets you get a comprehensive overview of your carbon emission performance.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292319\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Deepki lets you collect and aggregate data, such as energy, water and waste. The company tries to automate this process as much as possible using APIs, web scraping or connections to SFTP servers.<\/p>\n<p>It can be a good starting point to see how you stack up compared to legal requirements across various geographies. You can also extract data and use it for certifications.<\/p>\n<p>But using a product like Deepki can be particularly useful to see trends over time. From Deepki\u2019s data management and monitoring platform, you can see how your electricity or water consumption changes over time.<\/p>\n<p>Big corporate clients with multiple commercial properties can add several locations to Deepki and compare them on the platform. This way, you can prioritize one building over another to implement energy savings plans. It\u2019ll improve your overall carbon trajectory.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The Series C round has been led by Highland Europe and One Peak Partners. Bpifrance\u2019s Large Venture fund and Revaia are also participating in the investment. Some existing investors are also putting more money on the table, such as Hi Inov and Statkraft Ventures.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe global real estate sector needs to act now if it is to halve its emissions by 2030 and meet the net zero target by 2050. This represents a huge market opportunity for Deepki. Today\u2019s new funding announcement means that Deepki can make a greater impact and support even more asset owners in taking on the climate change challenge, and we are pleased to have our new partners Highland Europe and One Peak, as well as Revaia and Bpifrance Large Venture on this journey,\u201d co-founder and CEO Vincent Bryant said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see, Deepki develops a highly specific SaaS platform for clients with very specific needs. That\u2019s why the company also has a consulting service to help Deepki\u2019s customers implement ESG strategies and action plans.<\/p>\n<p>The company currently has 150 employees across five European capital cities. Deepki currently monitors buildings in 38 different countries, which represent over 500 million square meters. Clients include AEW, Tikehau, Generali RE, DeA Capital, Allianz Real Estate, Warburg HIH, Azora Capital and Neinver.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>French startup Deepki has raised a $166 million Series C funding round (\u20ac150 million).

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/24\/visa-to-acquire-open-banking-platform-tink-for-more-than-2-billion\/\">announced<\/a> that it would acquire <a href=\"https:\/\/tink.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tink<\/a> for \u20ac1.8 billion ($2.15 billion at the time of the deal). Klarna now wants to compete directly with Tink with a new business unit that has its own brand \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kosma.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Klarna Kosma<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Like Tink, Klarna offers an open banking application programming interface (API) with Klarna Kosma. Tink and Klarna are also both headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. There are other open banking API companies, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/truelayer.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TrueLayer<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/plaid.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Plaid<\/a>. And it&#8217;s been a competitive space as Visa also tried to acquire Plaid but that deal <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/12\/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall\/\">fell through<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>With this new strategy, Klarna is essentially saying that it\u2019s open for business. If you\u2019re building a financial product and need to interact with bank accounts, you have one more option.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291619\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Klarna Kosma is an API that other companies can integrate in their apps and services. These companies can leverage Klarna\u2019s API to access account statements, initiate payments, fetch banking information and refresh this data regularly.<\/p>\n<p>Klarna is better known for its &#8220;buy now, pay later&#8221; products. In some countries, Klarna lets customers connect to their bank account to give spending insights and establish a sort of credit score before letting customers buy something in multiple installments. With today\u2019s move, Klarna is opening up its in-house product to other customers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith Kosma we are opening up the power of our proprietary Open Banking platform and technology to banks, merchants and fintechs who share our dream of a world where consumers own their data and banks compete for customers by delivering value, not by locking in data,\u201d Klarna CTO Yaron Shaer said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>In Europe, banks and financial institutions all have to offer open banking interfaces due to the EU\u2019s Payment Services Directive PSD2. But there\u2019s no single standard. Open banking APIs do the heavy lifting for you.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Klarna said that it covers 15,000 banks across 24 countries.

href=\"http:\/\/workspaceupdates.googleblog.com\/2022\/03\/compose-with-markdown-in-google-docs-on.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a blog post<\/a> with Google Workspace customers announcing some good news for all <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Markdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Markdown<\/a> fans out there. Google Docs can now automatically convert Markdown formatting to rich text.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not familiar with Markdown, this markup language has become very popular over the past few years if you want to write structured documents \u2014 and especially web content. For instance, popular note-taking tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.notion.so\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Notion<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bear<\/a> support Markdown. Content management systems like WordPress also let you <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.com\/support\/wordpress-editor\/blocks\/markdown-block\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">enable Markdown<\/a> as a way to write new posts.<\/p>\n<p>This new feature for Google Docs is off by default. You have to manually turn it on in the settings first. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this post. If you want to enable Markdown support, open a document in Google Docs, head over to the top of the screen, go to &#8220;Tools&#8221; then &#8220;Preferences&#8221; and enable &#8220;Automatically detect Markdown.&#8221; After that, you\u2019re good to go. If you can&#8217;t see the feature today, that&#8217;s normal, as the company is rolling out the new feature progressively over the coming days.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291537\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Again, don\u2019t expect extensive Markdown support. Google Docs is still a rich text editor and this isn\u2019t going to magically change once you enable the Markdown feature.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, Google Docs will replace common Markdown formatting with rich text. For instance, you can create links with parentheses and brackets like <code>[this](https:\/\/techcrunch.com)<\/code>. You can italicize text by surrounding it with the <code>*<\/code> character.<\/p>\n<p>Google Docs supports different levels of headings, bold, italic, strikethrough and links. Numbered lists and unstructured lists still get automatically formatted like before.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, this new feature complements some keyboard shortcuts. It also makes it easier to copy Markdown content from one app to Google Docs, which can be particularly useful if you use a Markdown editor like <a href=\"https:\/\/ulysses.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ulysses<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But\u2026 that doesn\u2019t work the other way. What\u2019s great about Markdown is that it\u2019s a plain text format that is compatible with multiple apps and services.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Google Docs should let you natively export the current document as Markdown so that you can quickly copy and paste it anywhere Markdown is supported. I know, there is a plugin for that. But not all companies are comfortable with plugins.<\/p>\n<p>Hey Google, it\u2019s a nice first step, but you have to iterate and offer more Markdown features, please.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2291545\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg 1118w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg?resize=146,150 146w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg?resize=291,300 291w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg?resize=768,791 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg?resize=660,680 660w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google shared a blog post with Google Workspace customers announcing some good news for all Markdown fans out there.

with subpar soundbars, Devialet releases high-end soundbar"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Meet the Devialet Dione, a brand new speaker from high-end speaker manufacturer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.devialet.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Devialet<\/a>. With this new product, the company is entering a new market \u2014 home cinema sound systems. The Devialet Dione is an all-in-one soundbar compatible with Dolby Atmos 5.1.2 and it costs $2,400 (\u20ac2,190).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are at the high end of the market but we have a product that is an all-in-one audio system,\u201d Devialet CEO Franck Lebouchard told me. What he means by that is that you shouldn\u2019t compare the Dione with an average soundbar.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you\u2019re trying to find an equivalent device in Sonos\u2019 lineup, Lebouchard says you should compare Devialet\u2019s speaker with the Sonos Arc soundbar paired with two Sonos One speakers and a Sonos Sub. And that package currently costs more than $2,000 as well.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2290202\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cThe tech achievement is that we managed to put everything in a single device. It means that we had to make 17 speakers fit, which is unheard of,\u201d Lebouchard added.<\/p>\n<p>The company set up a testing room in its office in Paris and I could listen to the Devialet Dione with a large TV. We tried the speaker with the first few scenes of Mad Max: Fury Road. We also listened to some music.<\/p>\n<p>And, sure enough, the speaker sounds great. It produces some immersive sound and it feels like you\u2019re sitting in a movie theater rather than in front of a TV.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a full review. I\u2019m not an audio professional, so I don\u2019t know how the Devialet soundbar sounds when you compare it with the current top-of-the-line soundbars. I would recommend listening to the Devialet Dione in a store before buying it anyway.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn a Sennheiser soundbar, you\u2019ll find 12 speakers. We put 17 speakers. It\u2019s not completely magical, but when you can fit five more speakers in it, you can hear it,\u201d Lebouchard said.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2290203\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2290203\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2290203\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/3D-open-Devialet-Dione_3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/3D-open-Devialet-Dione_3.jpeg 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/3D-open-Devialet-Dione_3.jpeg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/3D-open-Devialet-Dione_3.jpeg?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/3D-open-Devialet-Dione_3.jpeg?resize=768,768 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/3D-open-Devialet-Dione_3.jpeg?resize=680,680 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/3D-open-Devialet-Dione_3.jpeg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/3D-open-Devialet-Dione_3.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/3D-open-Devialet-Dione_3.jpeg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/3D-open-Devialet-Dione_3.jpeg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/3D-open-Devialet-Dione_3.jpeg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/3D-open-Devialet-Dione_3.jpeg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2290203\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Devialet<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The device itself is a dense soundbar. It weighs 12kg and it is quite long \u2014 1.2 meters. You should think about getting a speaker like that if you already have a very large 55-inch TV.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to design, it is a bit more discreet than previous Devialet speakers. The signature egg-shaped Devialet design has been replaced with a more traditional polygon with sharp edges and corners.<\/p>\n<p>The only thing that stands out is a tiny sphere at the center of the device. There\u2019s a speaker inside that sphere and it pivots. This way, if you want to fix the soundbar to the wall, you can rotate the sphere so that it\u2019s always facing you.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the device, there are 17 different speakers \u2014 nine full-range drivers and eight rectangle subwoofers. Those subwoofers have been designed to fit the specifications of a soundbar. Again, what makes the Devialet Dione stand apart is that you don\u2019t need a separate subwoofer (or satellite speakers).<\/p>\n<p>The device also has its own digital-to-analog converter. In fact, the Devialet Dione uses the same system on a chip that you can find in the company\u2019s flagship products, the Phantom product line. Devialet has multiple patents for this specific chip and promises a sound with zero background noise, zero saturation and zero distorsion.<\/p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re playing a movie that doesn\u2019t support Dolby Atmos, the Devialet Dione can \u201cupscale\u201d the sound signal to 5.1.2 audio. There\u2019s also a live balance feature that helps you hear dialogue.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to connectivity, you plug the Devialet Dione to your TV using an HDMI cable with support for eARC and CEC. You can also use the soundbar as a standalone speaker to listen to music.<\/p>\n<p>The Devialet Dione connects to your local network using Wi-Fi or Ethernet. It also supports Bluetooth 5.0 and uses the same Devialet app. You don\u2019t necessarily have to use the app to play some music, as you can use Spotify Connect or AirPlay 2.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2290205\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2290205\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2290205\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Devialet-Dione_wall-mount-3_4.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Devialet-Dione_wall-mount-3_4.jpeg 7500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Devialet-Dione_wall-mount-3_4.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Devialet-Dione_wall-mount-3_4.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Devialet-Dione_wall-mount-3_4.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Devialet-Dione_wall-mount-3_4.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Devialet-Dione_wall-mount-3_4.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Devialet-Dione_wall-mount-3_4.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Devialet-Dione_wall-mount-3_4.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2290205\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Devialet<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>Not just for audiophiles<\/h2>\n<p>The company thinks there\u2019s a market opportunity with the Devialet Dione as streaming services release blockbuster movies on their services from day one. \u201cWe realized that it\u2019s a market that is taking off,\u201d Lebouchard said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur typical client is someone who has a beautiful 55-inch TV or bigger. And they want sound quality to be as good as image quality. It\u2019s a bit different from the typical Devialet client, who is someone who listens to a lot of music,\u201d he added.<\/p>\n<p>In 12 months, if the company wants to reach its business goals, the Devialet Dione should represent 20% of the company\u2019s revenue. And every time the startup launches a new product, it can lean on its dense network of points of sale. There are currently 1,900 Devialet points of sale around the world.<\/p>\n<p>While the company has stopped talking about funding rounds since its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/06\/18\/devialet-maker-of-phantom-speakers-closes-a-20m-series-b-round\/\">Series A in 2015<\/a>, Devialet has raised another \u20ac70 million across two rounds. The last funding round was a \u20ac50 million round with the company\u2019s existing investors in January 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Devialet is launching the Devialet Dione today in France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland.

co-founder and CEO Alice Zagury announced <a href=\"https:\/\/salon.thefamily.co\/tomber-et-se-relever-cb9dea4c52b3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in a blog post<\/a> that the French startup accelerator is suing Oussama Ammar for multiple claims \u2014\u00a0breach of trust, forgery and use of forgery.<\/p>\n<p>More specifically, Capital <a href=\"https:\/\/www.capital.fr\/economie-politique\/lincubateur-the-family-attaque-en-justice-son-co-fondateur-oussama-ammar-1432210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first reported<\/a> that The Family suspects Ammar of diverting \u20ac3 million that was supposed to be invested in several startups through syndicates. TechCrunch has separately seen an email that confirms ongoing charges against Ammar. It was sent to people who transferred money in order to become shareholders in Stripe through a special purpose vehicle. The SPV was supposed to acquire Stripe shares through a secondary offering.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOussama transfers funds to his personal holding companies and tells us after the fact, saying that it\u2019s the only way to take advantage of investment opportunities in question,\u201d Zagury wrote in her blog post.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2289842\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>According to her, other people working for The Family have asked several times to see documents that proved that investments went through. In November 2021, Ammar announced on LinkedIn that he was moving on and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/update\/urn:li:activity:6871047911644418049\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leaving The Family<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOn Friday, my resignation was published on the Companies House website. From now on I am no longer a director of The Family and I will gradually leave this ecosystem,\u201d Ammar wrote on LinkedIn <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/update\/urn:li:activity:6871047911644418049\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">at the time<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe ecosystem has changed a lot and raising money is not as difficult as it used to be. It has become normal to raise funds long before you have a product\/market fit, and this poses challenges to entrepreneurs that are of a very different nature than those the ecosystem has faced in the past years,\u201c he added back in November 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Zagury now says that The Family asked him to leave the company in September 2021. \u201cWe bring in a mediator then several law firms as well as an independent auditing firm (PwC),\u201d Zagury wrote.<\/p>\n<p>According to our information, The Family is working with several law firms across several jurisdictions. Capital talked with one of the company\u2019s lawyers, Elsa Sammari. She said that there are multiple ongoing cases being examined by criminal and commercial courts. \u201cThe Family has initiated two proceedings to freeze Oussama Ammar\u2019s assets and the assets of his personal holding companies,\u201d Sammari told Capital.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not going to be a straightforward case as Ammar\u2019s holding companies are spread all over the world, including in the Cayman Islands and Hong Kong. Ammar also recently edited his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/oussamaammar\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn profile<\/a> saying that he is based in Dubai.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday, Ammar has reacted to Capital\u2019s report in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/update\/urn:li:activity:6913846853348335616\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">another LinkedIn post<\/a>. \u201cThis is a legal proceeding between partners with some lingering resentment. Splitting up like this is a shame but it\u2019s frequent. Entrepreneurs know this well. Since 2020, we have been trying to find an amicable solution. But we haven\u2019t reached an agreement despite long hours of negotiation,\u201d Ammar wrote.<\/p>\n<p>In 2018, Ammar was given <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lexpress.fr\/actualite\/societe\/enquete\/la-face-cachee-d-un-gourou-de-la-tech_2016774.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a four-month suspended sentence<\/a> for a separate case. Back in 2011, Ammar used to work for a company called Be Sport. The company filed a lawsuit for breach of trust, forgery and use of forgery. At the time, Be Sport <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lemonde.fr\/economie\/article\/2018\/05\/07\/oussama-ammar-les-deux-visages-d-un-gourou-de-la-french-tech_5295503_3234.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">claimed<\/a> that Ammar had been using some of the company\u2019s funds for non-corporate expenses.<\/p>\n<p>The Family was originally founded in 2012 with three co-founders \u2014 Alice Zagury, Oussama Ammar and Nicolas Colin. They teamed up to build a different kind of startup accelerator without any batch or demo day. Instead, startups could apply and join the community of startups backed by The Family.<\/p>\n<p>In exchange for a stake, they could get advice from The Family\u2019s team and network with other people in the community. The Family has also helped some of the startups in its community when it comes to fundraising.<\/p>\n<p>Zagury listed some of The Family\u2019s portfolio companies in her blog post. They include Heetch, Algolia, Payfit, Spacefill, Trusk, Northflank, Jow, Joone, Jinka, Doctrine, Merci Handy, So Shape, Side, Vybe, Dark, Unai, WeMaintain, Flat, Fempo, Shipix, MyDiabby, Bellman, Fairmint, Artsper, Caba\u00efa, Plume, Alma and Kymono.<\/p>\n<p>A few years ago, The Family was a cornerstone of the French tech ecosystem.

French startup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.malt.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Malt<\/a> is acquiring <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comatch.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Comatch<\/a>, a competing marketplace focused on consultants and industry experts. Comatch originally started in Germany, which means that Malt is also doubling down on the German market with this acquisition. Terms of the deal are undisclosed, but it involves a mix of equity and cash.<\/p>\n<p>Malt started as a marketplace that matches freelance developers, designers and other technical workers with companies looking for talent. The startup has raised <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/31\/malt-raises-97m-at-a-489m-valuation-for-its-freelance-marketplace-for-developers\/\">quite a lot of money<\/a> and has managed to attract 340,000 freelancers across multiple European countries.<\/p>\n<p>Originally limited to the French market, Malt has expanded to Germany, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland over the past few years; 40,000 companies have turned to Malt to find a freelancer or several freelancers.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2289084\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Clients include Unilever, Lufthansa, Bosch, BlaBlaCar, L\u2019Or\u00e9al and Allianz. As you can see, a lot of large-sized companies have used Malt at some point.<\/p>\n<p>Malt focuses exclusively on high-skilled freelancing jobs that can fill a gap when a new project comes up. In addition to developers, Malt now also offers opportunities for marketing and communications professionals, graphic designers and more.<\/p>\n<p>Using a platform like Malt can be particularly useful when you\u2019re getting started as a freelancer and you don\u2019t have a big network of potential clients. Malt also helps you take care of the administrative paperwork. Freelancers can charge their clients from Malt directly and, of course, Malt takes a small cut.<\/p>\n<p>As for Comatch, the company roughly follows the same model, but with a specific focus on management consultants and industry experts. Malt hasn\u2019t specifically targeted business consultants so far. So the company is entering a new vertical.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cComatch is a champion in the field of business consulting marketplaces. As a fellow company that shares Malt\u2019s \u2018community first\u2019 approach, placing our talents at the core of the product and business to our vision for the future of work, we are eager and excited to bring our two worlds of high-skilled freelancers together,\u201d Malt co-founder and CEO Vincent Huguet said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Malt also wants to become the go-to freelancer marketplace in Europe. Comatch has attracted 15,000 freelancers across nine markets and the two companies work with 80% of publicly traded companies on the CAC 40 and DAX 40. Comatch represents an interesting external growth opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>Following this acquisition, Malt has some ambitious goals. By 2024, the company expects to generate \u20ac1 billion in business volume, and it plans to hire another 150 employees by the end of 2022.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ChKsqBZqx2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/31\/malt-raises-97m-at-a-489m-valuation-for-its-freelance-marketplace-for-developers\/\">Malt raises $97M at a $489M valuation for its freelance marketplace for developers<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Malt raises $97M at a $489M valuation for its freelance marketplace for developers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/31\/malt-raises-97m-at-a-489m-valuation-for-its-freelance-marketplace-for-developers\/embed\/#?secret=FuEe9jgdpd#?secret=ChKsqBZqx2\" data-secret=\"ChKsqBZqx2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s consolidation time in the freelancer marketplace industry.

rel=\"noopener\">Bigblue<\/a> has raised a $15 million Series A funding round. The company operates an order fulfillment platform for direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands. In other words, a D2C brand can outsource all things related to logistics to Bigblue so that they can focus on product and marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Runa Capital is leading the round, with LPV acting as the &#8220;secondary lead investor.&#8221; Existing investor Samaipata is also participating once again.<\/p>\n<p>The startup currently operates in three countries \u2014 France, Spain and the U.K. It has signed partnerships with five different warehouses representing over 60,000 square meters of storage space. Bigblue customers can ship their products directly to these warehouses so that they are stored and managed by Bigblue.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2289012\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>After that, every time a customer orders something from a Bigblue client, the product is shipped to the end customer using Bigblue\u2019s carrier network. The startup has integrations with more than 20 different carriers and can ship all across Europe \u2014 and even globally, but finding different D2C fulfillment partners in other markets might be a smarter move.<\/p>\n<p>Bigblue lets you customize your packaging and add flyers in the package to personalize the experience for end customers. And if there\u2019s something wrong, customers are invited to file a return request on a branded return portal. It supports store credit as well as refunds.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith this new round we will support scaling service offerings for Bigblue\u2019s growing base of online merchants, fuel hiring efforts, and continue to position the company as the leader in the D2C fulfillment space,\u201d co-founder and CEO Tim Dumain said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>The result is quite simple. Bigblue wants to offer an Amazon-like experience, but with a third-party logistics stack. Bigblue integrates with many different sales channels, such as Shopify, WooCommerce, PrestaShop, Wix and Magento, as well as various marketplaces on Cdiscount, Fnac and, yes, Amazon.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It means that you can promise free one-day or two-day deliveries across various marketplaces. And this is key when it comes to getting picked as the main seller on a product page on an online marketplace. Customers also get branded tracking emails.<\/p>\n<p>The startup competes with other D2C e-commerce logistics companies, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cubyn.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cubyn<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hive.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hive<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huboo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Huboo<\/a>. Overall, Bigblue has managed to attract 300 customers, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/en.fromfuture.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">From Future<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/unbottled.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unbottled<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/wearejolies.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">We Are Jolies<\/a>. The company plans to ship 4 million parcels this year. Over the next 12 months, the startup plans to hire another 100 employees and expand across Western Europe.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>French startup Bigblue has raised a $15 million Series A funding round.

raises $50 million to turn any website into a multilingual site"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">French startup <a href=\"https:\/\/weglot.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Weglot<\/a> has closed a $50 million Series A funding round (\u20ac45 million) from <a href=\"https:\/\/partechpartners.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Partech<\/a>. The company has built a translation solution for websites. It helps you add more languages to your site without a lot of tweaking and without having to switch to a different CMS or e-commerce platform.<\/p>\n<p>And this is key to understanding Weglot\u2019s positioning. Translation plugins for WordPress of Shopify have been around for a while. But Weglot wants to build a universal product that works for all sorts of web experiences.<\/p>\n<p>There are two ways to take advantage of Weglot. You can add it to your existing website with a plugin \u2014 this is how Weglot works with WordPress, Shopify, Wix and WooCommerce. If you run a small company and don\u2019t have a dedicated web developer, you could install Weglot without writing any line of code.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2287972\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The other way is that you can add a few lines of Javascript to the <code>&lt;head&gt;<\/code> tag of your website. Weglot uses this approach for Webflow, Squarespace and BigCommerce. You also need to tweak your DNS records to create subdomains or subdirectories for new languages.<\/p>\n<p>On Weglot\u2019s servers, the company automatically detects and pulls content from the site. Weglot customers can use automatic translation to get started with new languages.<\/p>\n<p>The company also offers a dashboard so that you can dive into your content and create better translations. You can grant access to professional translators and manage translations from that interface.<\/p>\n<p>After that, you have a multilingual site. Whenever a visitor loads your site, the website will load in their preferred language by default. You can also add a language switcher in the corner of your website if you want to offer multiple options.<\/p>\n<p>Even though translations are stored on Weglot\u2019s servers, Weglot creates dedicated subdirectories or subdomains for each language. This way, Google and other search engines can index each language variant of your website. Metadata and keywords can also be translated with Weglot.<\/p>\n<p>The startup charges a <a href=\"https:\/\/weglot.com\/pricing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">monthly subscription<\/a> depending on the number of languages and words that you need. Last year, Weglot has reached $11 million (\u20ac10 million) in annual recurring revenue. Not bad for a startup that hasn\u2019t raised any outside capital since its seed round in 2017.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>French startup Weglot has closed a $50 million Series A funding round (\u20ac45 million) from Partech.

startup that wants to expose CO2 emissions calculations so that customers are better informed when they purchase something online. When companies start using Lune\u2019s API, they can also let their customers pay a fee to finance a carbon neutralization project.<\/p>\n<p>Before founding Lune with Roberto Bruggemann, Erik Stadigh previously worked for VC fund <a href=\"https:\/\/crane.vc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crane<\/a>, which led Lune&#8217;s $4 million seed round. In addition, 15 business angels &#8212; including N26 co-founder Maximilian Tayenthal, Voi co-founder Fredrik Hjelm, and OysterHR and Nexmo co-founder Tony Jamous &#8212;\u00a0participated.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe way things work today is that companies create a sustainability report that is hidden away on the website and very few people read it,\u201d co-founder Stadigh told me.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2286596\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The startup first helps you measure the carbon impact. As always, those are just estimations. \u201cWe offer automated carbon emission calculations and follow best practice guidelines,\u201d Stadigh said.<\/p>\n<p>And once you integrate the API in your product, customers can choose to pay a bit more to contribute to compensation projects. \u201cWe partner with carbon offset developers across the world,\u201d Stadigh said.<\/p>\n<p>Lune also works directly with payment companies, such as TrueLayer. When it\u2019s time to check out, customers can choose a \u201cgreen payment method\u201d that will contribute to carbon offset projects.<\/p>\n<p>From the merchant\u2019s perspective, Lune customers can choose to pay for those projects or let customers pay the extra fee. Lune is already talking with other payment partners to offer more payment integrations.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Lune charges based on the number of calculations and also takes a small cut on carbon offsetting transactions. With Lune\u2019s API, the startup wants to turn any company into a climate-friendly company.<\/p>\n<p>Many would say that not purchasing a product is the best way to reduce the carbon impact of that potential purchase. But when you can\u2019t avoid a purchase, it could help customers pick one company over another.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2286600\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2286600\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2286600\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Lune-team.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Lune-team.jpeg 2880w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Lune-team.jpeg?resize=150,65 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Lune-team.jpeg?resize=300,130 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Lune-team.jpeg?resize=768,333 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Lune-team.jpeg?resize=680,295 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Lune-team.jpeg?resize=1536,666 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Lune-team.jpeg?resize=2048,887 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Lune-team.jpeg?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2286600\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Lune<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meet Lune, a new startup that wants to expose CO2 emissions calculations so that customers are better informed when they purchase something online.

individuals and teams. The company is unveiling its app this week and users can sign up to the waitlist. Amie is a well-designed calendar app that helps you get things done and keep up with your team.<\/p>\n<p>Amie was founded by Dennis M\u00fcller, who previously worked as a product manager for challenger bank <a href=\"https:\/\/n26.com\">N26<\/a>. Creandum, as well as Tiny.VC and several business angels, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/09\/amie\/\">backed the company<\/a> early on so that it could work on its product without too much pressure.<\/p>\n<p>And what I saw during a demo with M\u00fcller was a polished app that could easily attract a loyal user base. There are a lot of tiny details that make it much more convenient than the default option for many companies, which is Google Calendar.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2286124\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>When you open Amie, it looks like a calendar, there\u2019s no question about it. You can see the current week with all your events, click on an event to get details and move from one week to another.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2286126\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2286126\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2286126\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/calendar-\u2013-for-romain.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/calendar-\u2013-for-romain.png 1080w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/calendar-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=150,98 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/calendar-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=300,195 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/calendar-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=768,499 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/calendar-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=680,442 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/calendar-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2286126\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Amie<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>But Amie is quite opinionated in its feature set, and especially around todo items. You can open your todo list in a column right next to your calendar and view them this way. But you can also drag them from the sidebar and drop them in the main calendar view to assign a date and time to your todo.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to achieve something, the easiest way to do it is put it in your calendar, assign a time to it,\u201d M\u00fcller told me. And it\u2019s true that many people already use their calendar as a sort of todo list already. The fact that todos can live in the sidebar or in your week view gives more flexibility than adding your todos to your calendar directly.<\/p>\n<p>In the left-side column, you can also see a list of avatars. If you\u2019re using Slack intensively, it looks a bit like the icons on the left to switch from one workspace to another.<\/p>\n<p>In Amie\u2019s case, those icons represent other people in your team. Like in instant messengers, you can see if they\u2019re currently available or busy based on their calendar. And if you hover over their avatar, you can toggle their calendar. For instance, it\u2019s a good way to find out when it would be a good time to set up a meeting.<\/p>\n<p>Each person also gets their own profile. On this separate page, you can see what someone is doing right now, get a reminder about their birthday, add a few notes and view when was the last time you were together. You can also set recurring reminders. It\u2019s a lightweight feature that could help you stay in touch with people more regularly.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2286127\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2286127\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2286127\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/profiles-\u2013-for-romain.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/profiles-\u2013-for-romain.png 1080w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/profiles-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=150,98 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/profiles-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=300,195 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/profiles-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=768,499 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/profiles-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=680,442 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/profiles-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2286127\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Amie<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>You also get some information from third-party services. For instance, you can see the current song playing from this person\u2019s Spotify account. You can also open their Twitter profile from there.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese calendar apps that are really focused on one person are cool. But if you look at other products that are successful today and if you want to generate some kind of network effects, we realized that we had to build some kind of profile,\u201d M\u00fcller told me.<\/p>\n<p>The instant benefit of adding a social component to the calendar is that you can more easily stay on top of the company\u2019s activities. Amie has a home view with an activity feed. On this screen, you can see when someone creates an event.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s full of information and it could be particularly useful for companies with a transparent culture. \u201cThe home view could become the modern intranet,\u201d M\u00fcller said.<\/p>\n<p>On this home view, you can also see a list of all your events and todos. You can check things off from this view.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Amie has many of the power features that you would expect from a modern productivity tool. With just a keyboard shortcut, you can open a quick action menu, create an event, move to another view, etc.<\/p>\n<p>When you want to share your availabilities with someone else, you can choose some slots in your calendar and share a link with the other person \u2014\u00a0no Calendly required. When an event is coming up with a video call, you can join the call with a keyboard shortcut.<\/p>\n<p>Amie currently works with Google accounts on macOS and Windows. There\u2019s also an iPhone app and the company is working on an Android app as well. On mobile, Amie has tried to locate all the important buttons and gestures near the bottom of the screen so that you don\u2019t have to move your hand to reach a button in the corner.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re currently experiencing a calendar renaissance. Many startups are trying to find the right formula to reinvent the calendar app for the Notion era. Amie competes with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/28\/rise-is-a-new-calendar-app-with-a-scheduling-engine-for-teams\/\">Rise<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/18\/cron-is-a-new-calendar-app-following-in-sunrises-footsteps\/\">Cron<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/25\/hera-is-a-new-calendar-app-for-people-with-a-lot-of-virtual-meetings\/\">Hera<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/08\/fantastical-lets-you-share-a-link-to-schedule-meetings-no-calendly-required\/\">Fantastical<\/a> and others.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s arguably a big market. So it\u2019s good to see so much innovation in the space. \u201cFor us, the calendar is the canvas,\u201d M\u00fcller told me. \u201cWe do our job right if you sign up and you never open Google Calendar again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2286125\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2286125\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2286125\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/booking-page-\u2013-for-romain.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/booking-page-\u2013-for-romain.png 1080w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/booking-page-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=150,98 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/booking-page-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=300,195 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/booking-page-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=768,499 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/booking-page-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=680,442 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/booking-page-\u2013-for-romain.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2286125\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Amie<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PeA6qnIIQC\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/09\/amie\/\">Creandum backs Amie, a new productivity app from ex-N26 product manager Dennis M\u00fcller<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Creandum backs Amie, a new productivity app from ex-N26 product manager Dennis M\u00fcller&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/09\/amie\/embed\/#?secret=CssHauMhQF#?secret=PeA6qnIIQC\" data-secret=\"PeA6qnIIQC\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meet Amie, a startup working on a brand new productivity app for both individuals and teams.

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Galion<\/a>, a collective of tech entrepreneurs who network and learn from each other, is launching an investment arm called <a href=\"https:\/\/galion.exe.vc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Galion.exe<\/a>. They have already raised \u20ac30 million ($33 million at today\u2019s exchange rate) and aim to reach a total fund size of \u20ac60 to \u20ac80 million ($66 million to $88 million).<\/p>\n<p>Originally founded in 2015, The Galion Project started as a sort of think tank for the tech community. For instance, they came up with a template for a fair term sheet.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJean-Baptiste Rudelle was convinced that we would have more unicorns in the French tech ecosystem,\u201d Galion co-founder and CEO Agathe Wautier told me. \u201cThe goal was to share as much as possible to think bigger and go faster. Very quickly, we created the think tank. We put together a knowledge base with several reports and tools for entrepreneurs, made by entrepreneurs.\u201d<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2285930\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>That project is still going well as there are currently 400 active members in the Galion community. In order to join this community, you have to prove that you have raised at least \u20ac3 million, you need to be invited by two Galion peers and you need to pay \u20ac2,000 every year.<\/p>\n<p>But very quickly, some entrepreneurs in the community became business angels. Some of them wanted to work together on deals and form syndicates.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt some point, there was so much demand that we thought we had to do something ourselves,\u201d Wautier said.<\/p>\n<p>Around the same time, Willy Braun and Kevin Kuipers left another Paris-based VC fund, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.daphni.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daphni<\/a>. Chlo\u00e9 Monneyron joined the pair as an associate VC and they all started working on Galion&#8217;s investment fund.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>They first started raising Galion.exe from the Galion community. I\u2019m told the barrier to entry was quite low as you could participate in the fund with the minimum legal amount for this kind of investment.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to those individual investors, Galion.exe will round up its fund with more traditional limited partners, such as institutional investors, family offices, private banks, etc.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we left Daphni, we had a strong thesis on seed rounds. When you look at the amount and number of deals, everything has doubled from Series A rounds and beyond,\u201d Braun told me. But the same isn\u2019t necessarily true for seed rounds.<\/p>\n<p>Galion.exe now plans to invest in a dozen companies every year and fill that seed gap in France. The team will be able to invest anything between \u20ac700,000 and \u20ac2.5 million so that they can lead the seed round without any co-investor (even though they don\u2019t exclude co-investments altogether).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor the first time, seed-stage companies will be able to join the Galion community,\u201d Kuipers told me.<\/p>\n<p>And that could be a win-win for everyone involved. Portfolio companies will be able to learn from peers, get introductions and apply some best practices. And Galion.exe could convince early-stage startups to sign a term sheet with them based on that argument alone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s a new seed fund in town, but with a familiar name.

Those dark stores are operated by Getir and the company also controls and owns the inventory of products.<\/p>\n<p>After that, a delivery person on a bike or moped scooter delivers your order as quickly as possible. It means that you can expect to receive your order in \u201cminutes,\u201d the company\u2019s website says. More realistically, you should get it 20 to 40 minutes later.<\/p>\n<p>The company has managed to attract 40 million app downloads across nine countries. Overall, Getir manages 1,100 dark stores. That\u2019s why these instant delivery startups have been raising mega-rounds of funding &#8212; it\u2019s a capital-intensive industry.<\/p>\n<p>Getir is quite dominant in Turkey, currently operating in 81 cities. The company covers 48 cities for all other markets \u2014 the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Portugal and the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are defining the ultrafast delivery sector and this latest round of funding is a testament to Getir\u2019s position as industry pioneer. In such an exciting and competitive market we cannot afford to stand still. This investment will enable us to further develop our proposition and technology, as well as invest in our employees to continue to attract the best talent,\u201d Getir founder Nazim Salur said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>The company competes with <a href=\"https:\/\/gopuff.com\/go\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gopuff<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goflink.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flink<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/gorillas.io\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gorillas<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/tryzapp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zapp<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cajoo.eu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cajoo<\/a> and more.

raised a $5 million seed round. The startup lets you turn a regular web app into a multiplayer product with high-level hosted APIs. In addition to its live presence state API, the company is launching its live storage API.<\/p>\n<p>Boldstart is leading today\u2019s round.

But letting multiple people interact with the same document, form, whiteboard or piece of content is still incredibly hard.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2276412\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Liveblocks essentially helps you get there faster. The startup first released a live presence state API. When you open a document in Google Docs, you can see several profile pictures in the top-right corner. It tells you who is viewing a document right now. And you can see if someone else is moving their cursor or selecting some text.<\/p>\n<p>When you integrate Liveblocks\u2019 presence API, you can take advantage of the API to display the list of people currently viewing a document just like in Google Docs. It can also track everyone\u2019s cursors in real time.<\/p>\n<p>While this is somewhat useful, the startup has been working on another API that opens up a lot of possibilities. With its live storage API, several people can view and edit data simultaneously. It can be used to create collaborative whiteboards, a note-taking app, a multiplayer CMS, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The hardest part of real-time data collaboration is conflict resolution. Liveblocks tries to minimize issues with offline support, and multiplayer undo and redo. If you\u2019re using a library like Zustand or Redux, you can integrate Liveblocks so that multiple users can interact with data at the same time.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Over the past three months, the total number of connections to Liveblocks rooms have increased by 10x. And this metric should increase rapidly as remote work and software-as-a-service products become more popular.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LJw6tzFDft\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/16\/liveblocks-is-an-api-that-lets-you-add-real-time-collaboration-to-your-product\/\">Liveblocks is an API that lets you add real-time collaboration to your product<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Liveblocks is an API that lets you add real-time collaboration to your product&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/16\/liveblocks-is-an-api-that-lets-you-add-real-time-collaboration-to-your-product\/embed\/#?secret=kcQwmKNjrK#?secret=LJw6tzFDft\" data-secret=\"LJw6tzFDft\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Liveblocks has raised a $5 million seed round.

rel=\"noopener\">SpaceFill<\/a> has raised a $27 million funding round (\u20ac25 million) led by NGP Capital with Maersk Growth and existing investors Eurazeo and La Famiglia also participating. The company is building a warehousing cloud across several European countries that offers both flexibility and transparency.<\/p>\n<p>SpaceFill doesn\u2019t work with e-commerce companies trying to store goods before shipping them to customers. Instead, the company focuses exclusively on the B2B side of the industry, which is arguably the larger side of the industry. You could compare SpaceFill to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexe.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flexe<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stord.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stord<\/a> \u2014 but SpaceFill focuses on Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The company has built a network of 1,500 warehouses that are all connected to the same software orchestrating layer. This software layer acts as\u00a0a sort of control tower for your inventory and logistics strategy.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284063\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Those warehouses are third-party logistics providers that have chosen to allocate part of their warehousing space to SpaceFill customers. They can still accept their own customers, but they can more easily fill up the rest of their warehouses thanks to SpaceFill.<\/p>\n<p>On the other side, SpaceFill acts as a long-term logistics partner. Instead of working with a traditional logistics outsourcing company, SpaceFill becomes your logistics partner.<\/p>\n<p>Customers can leverage SpaceFill\u2019s network for cross-docking operations, which means that a truck can drop several goods in a warehouse so that multiple trucks can pick up a smaller quantity of those goods and move them to another location.<\/p>\n<p>SpaceFill also handles variations in capacity needs, which can be particularly useful for your seasonality strategy. Just like cloud storage, you can easily store more goods (and pay more), or reduce your storage capacity when you need less warehousing space.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the logistics industry, the tech stack is super old and super hard to interconnect,\u201d co-founder and CEO Maxime Huzar told me. \u201cWe have built a sort of power adapter that connects with the entire network.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>SpaceFill currently serves 500 customers, such as Ikea, Angell Bike and Leroy Merlin. It has 60 employees and generates more than \u20ac10 million in revenue. The company plans to hire another 80 employees to improve its platform and expand its network.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>French startup SpaceFill has raised a $27 million funding round (\u20ac25 million) led by NGP Capital with Maersk Growth and existing investors Eurazeo and La Famiglia also participating.

Mykhailo Fedorov talks about corporate sanctions and running a government during wartime"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">The Russian army<\/span> started invading Ukraine three weeks ago. And the conflict has been multifaceted from day one. In addition to the ground war, the Ukrainian government quickly reacted on the digital front. Representatives asked for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/02\/how-ukraine-is-spending-crypto-donations\/\">cryptocurrency donations<\/a>, called out tech companies so that they would <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/ukraine-war\/\">suspend<\/a> sales and services in Russia and organized a digital resistance.<\/p>\n<p>One of the public figures that embody the government\u2019s reaction to the Russian invasion is Mykhailo Fedorov. In 2019, he became Ukraine\u2019s first minister of Digital Transformation at the age of 28. He is also the vice prime minister of Ukraine. The country\u2019s deputy minister for Digital Transformation Oleksandr (Alex) Bornyakov has also played an important part in Ukraine&#8217;s government \u2014 TechCrunch&#8217;s Ingrid Lunden <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/02\/ukraine-deputy-minister-talks-it-army-and-deploying-25m-in-donated-crypto\/\">interviewed Bornyakov last week<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur vision with President Zelensky \u2014 before the war \u2014 was to build the world\u2019s most convenient country in terms of digitally available public services,\u201d Mykhailo Fedorov said in an interview with TechCrunch earlier today.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2284915\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>While many of those projects are currently on hold, the Ukrainian government already sees the benefits of its digital transformation efforts. Fedorov is also very active on the digital diplomacy front. He is well aware that Big Tech companies have become quite powerful when it comes to international relations. That\u2019s why he is doing whatever he can to have them on Ukraine\u2019s side.<\/p>\n<p>In a wide-ranging interview on Zoom and with the help of a translator, Fedorov also shared some insights about what it\u2019s like to participate in a government during wartime. The interview has been slightly edited for clarity and brevity.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: Where are you right now? Can you tell us about your current personal situation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mykhailo Fedorov:<\/strong> I\u2019m at the very center of action. I can\u2019t quite give you a geolocation for security reasons but let me assure you we stay in touch with the president\u2019s team 24\/7 about all the projects.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I\u2019m sure your daily life is very different right now from what it was a couple of months ago. Can you tell us about your day-to-day job and role during the war against Russia?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are a very young ministry. We have been created by President Zelensky when he was elected to implement some crucial parts of his program. Before the election I was the head of his digital campaign. After he got elected, we joined forces to implement our shared vision of a digital country.<\/p>\n<p>And our vision with President Zelensky \u2014 before the war \u2014 was to build the world\u2019s most convenient country in terms of digitally available public services. And our goal was to create a government where services would be available in a double tap. They would be semi-automated with as little interference with public officials as possible. In other words, we tried to be more resemblant of an Uber than a government as you would expect it to be.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is there any way you can leverage those digital public services to help Ukrainians during this time of crisis?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We have created something like a factory to launch public services. That\u2019s enabled by our app which has 15 million users. And it\u2019s also enabled by the interactions of all of the government-run databases that we\u2019ve been able to implement through this period of time, and also by our management structure, which has been fine-tuned to basically launch new services and provide these things.<\/p>\n<p>For example, during wartime, we\u2019ve been able to launch such services as cash payouts to people who have been forced to resettle from areas that were badly affected by combat. Also, we\u2019ve been able to embed free public television and free radio. We also added the possibility to raise money for the army through official channels.<\/p>\n<p>We have services that allow us to track and report on the enemy movements as well. It\u2019s basically crowdsourced intelligence, and we\u2019ve been able to launch that in just a couple of days since the war erupted.<\/p>\n<p>Because our internal ID is a very specific document and not everybody has it. But during war time, we\u2019ve been able to launch an additional document that has all of the vital information for internal mobility and getting public services no matter who you are and where you are and what your status is. We\u2019re also working on a service to basically provide an inventory of your property if it has been damaged or destroyed by the war for future processes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>These services imply that you can get a good connection to internet services where you are right now. What\u2019s the current status of both cellular and landline connectivity?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would say that we are very stable and confident at the moment because of our telecom industry. I think they are real heroes because they work around the clock. And whenever there\u2019s an outage, they go out and fix it.<\/p>\n<p>So we are able to maintain stable internet connectivity throughout most of the country. We also have the largest number of Starlink terminals anywhere in the EU.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s the plan for sensitive data that you hold from both the army and the government? Is data based in Ukraine right now? And do you have plans to relocate data to foreign countries to prepare for a worst case scenario?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Building a digital state increases your exposure, your surface of attack, which means that we have been always very mindful and very serious about cybersecurity. Also, as we we have been building our digital state, we have been constantly targeted by the Russian Federation with cyber attacks.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tI think that, in the future, governments will resemble tech companies, not classical governments.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<cite>Mykhailo Fedorov<\/cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Without elaborating, I would like to say that our data is safe. We have backups. We have means to ensure consistency and safety of the data. This means that our services will remain reliable and available for Ukrainian citizens no matter what happens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I want to change the topic and talk about corporate sanctions against Russia, because you\u2019ve been calling out companies on Twitter and in media outlets saying that companies from Europe and North America should suspend sales in Russia right now. Where does this idea come from and do you think it\u2019s effective?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We call this project digital blockade. And we believe that this is a very crucial component to winning this war. And I think that, in the future, governments will resemble tech companies, not classical governments.<\/p>\n<p>Digital platforms provide some vital services. They have become so embedded into the fabric of society. Once you start removing these services from the aggressor, one by one, you actually damage their fabric of society and you make it very uncomfortable for them to go along with their daily lives.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019d like to think of this as a completely new and unexplored battlefield. And this is a complementary measure to sanctions which we expect is going to push the development of Russia back decades.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tWhen you create these unfavorable conditions in Russia, you&#8217;re likely to cause the tech talent to move elsewhere.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<cite>Mykhailo Fedorov<\/cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>I also think that high-tech businesses create tremendous added value. And that\u2019s why Tesla is worth more than Gazprom. People who create this added value, the tech talent, they\u2019re actually very mobile and nomadic. When you create these unfavorable conditions in Russia, you\u2019re likely to cause the tech talent to move elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>This is why we are committed to making this digital blockade as thorough and as comprehensive as we can. Up until the moment when Russian tanks and soldiers leave our country and stop killing our people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are there some companies that haven\u2019t done enough in your opinion and should do more to suspend sales and stop doing business in Russia?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think one company I\u2019d particularly like to call out is SAP. It\u2019s a German company that provides ERP to banks and major enterprises. Basically, they contribute to the aggressive war by providing IT infrastructure to Russian companies and also by paying taxes in Russia. Thus, they support the army that is murdering Ukrainian nationals and civilians.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can you talk about the tech industry and tech community in Ukraine right now? Because obviously we tend to cover a lot of what\u2019s happening in the tech community and we would like to know how tech talent in Ukraine is reacting right now.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are about 300,000 tech talent in Ukraine. Most of these international companies have been able to stabilize their operations and ensure business continuity in Ukraine. Even though it\u2019s been challenging but most of them are managing to do it.<\/p>\n<p>We try to cater to the needs of our tech companies by providing them with broadband internet, with safe locations, with some tax stimulus, as well as with mobility. So basically, we aim to be their one-stop shop \u2014 should they have problems.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Yesterday, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/technology\/exclusive-ukraine-has-started-using-clearview-ais-facial-recognition-during-war-2022-03-13\/\">a report<\/a> came out saying that the Ukrainian army has been using Clearview AI\u2019s facial recognition technology. Can you tell us more about this partnership with Clearview AI?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would say that this project is currently in very early development. I would not be in a position to comment on the progress but once we have results I would be glad to share results.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What kind of use cases do you have in mind when leveraging Clearview AI?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would start off by saying that most of these use cases would not be public, not something that we\u2019d be able to share publicly.<\/p>\n<p>But something that I can just give you a sneak peek would be our work with the Ministry of Internal Affairs. We would be trying to identify Russian forces who have been killed or taken prisoner in Ukraine. As you know, the Russian government starts to deny their presence, send them without documents, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Another one would be checking people who cross our roadblocks. Another one would be looking for missing persons.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hEkiVGTBEd\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/02\/ukraine-deputy-minister-talks-it-army-and-deploying-25m-in-donated-crypto\/\">Ukraine deputy minister talks IT Army and deploying $25M in donated crypto<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Ukraine deputy minister talks IT Army and deploying $25M in donated crypto&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/02\/ukraine-deputy-minister-talks-it-army-and-deploying-25m-in-donated-crypto\/embed\/#?secret=6XRTKOIVQi#?secret=hEkiVGTBEd\" data-secret=\"hEkiVGTBEd\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><strong>I want to ask you about cryptocurrency donations as well.

The Parliament has adopted a law on virtual assets. I think the president is about to sign it into law in a matter of days. So we strive to be as friendly to virtual assets as possible.

And our government has been working especially hard to liberalize the economy and remove all hurdles, roadblocks and bottlenecks in our economy. We are simplifying tax rules. We are opening up our customs and \u2014 gee \u2014 we\u2019re even trying to develop our country economically despite the war.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I think I\u2019ve asked everything I wanted to know about the current state.

The company plans to create a suite of products and expand beyond appointment booking.<\/p>\n<p>And the company has already added some new SaaS products, just like Salesforce is always iterating on its suite of products. In addition to a telehealth add-on, the startup has a product called <a href=\"https:\/\/info.doctolib.fr\/doctolib-medecin\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Doctolib M\u00e9decin<\/a> that can help you centralize documents, see a patient\u2019s history, take notes and issue invoices.<\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/info.doctolib.fr\/doctolib-team\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Doctolib Team<\/a>, the company is creating an instant messaging service for health professionals. They could use the service to securely talk about patients and send documents.<\/p>\n<p>As Doctolib operates in a highly sensitive industry, the company has also been investing in security and privacy. Doctolib acquired Tanker, as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/11\/healthcare-tech-platform-doctolib-acquires-encryption-startup-tanker\/\">I first reported<\/a>. Tanker is a turnkey solution that helps you enable end-to-end encryption in a medical application.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, 300,000 healthcare workers are using Doctolib \u2014 not all of them pay for a monthly subscription. The startup also works with 250 public hospitals. And if you\u2019re living in France, you know that Doctolib has become ubiquitous.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PdgeN5enu9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/11\/healthcare-tech-platform-doctolib-acquires-encryption-startup-tanker\/\">Healthcare tech platform Doctolib acquires encryption startup Tanker<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Healthcare tech platform Doctolib acquires encryption startup Tanker&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/11\/healthcare-tech-platform-doctolib-acquires-encryption-startup-tanker\/embed\/#?secret=wa9wNPWAVN#?secret=PdgeN5enu9\" data-secret=\"PdgeN5enu9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"edXwIkzxvL\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/10\/doctolib-is-now-used-by-300000-doctors-and-medical-workers\/\">Doctolib is now used by 300,000 doctors and medical workers<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Doctolib is now used by 300,000 doctors and medical workers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/10\/doctolib-is-now-used-by-300000-doctors-and-medical-workers\/embed\/#?secret=YTbQQyl72t#?secret=edXwIkzxvL\" data-secret=\"edXwIkzxvL\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>French startup Doctolib has announced that is has raised a new funding round.

Instead of buying those bikes, Motto customers will be able to rent them for a fixed price of \u20ac75 per month (around $82 at today\u2019s exchange rate).<\/p>\n<p>Customers get Motto-branded electric bikes with a motor in the rear wheel that helps you pedal up to a speed of 25km\/h. It has integrated lights, a GPS tracker and an anti-theft system. It features a carbon belt and the battery is removable.<\/p>\n<p>The battery is integrated into the seat tube, meaning that you can access the battery by removing the saddle and taking it with you. There are two different models, a step-over model and a low-step model. The frame is slightly different but everything else is identical.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2283992\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>But Motto doesn\u2019t want to stop at hardware. Users aren\u2019t just renting a bike &#8212; they\u2019re subscribing to a service. The monthly subscription fee includes damage and theft insurance, as well as on-demand maintenance and repairs.<\/p>\n<p>When there\u2019s something wrong with your Motto bike, you can open the app and request a repair within 48 hours. In the near future, Motto plans to offer a baby carrier and a front rack as subscription add-ons.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2283997\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2283997\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2283997\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg 3986w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=300,187 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=768,480 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=680,425 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=2048,1279 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Motto-2.jpeg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2283997\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Motto<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The startup has raised a $4.4 million (\u20ac4 million) seed round led by Cassius Family and Founders Future. Several business angels are also participating. Before rebranding to Motto, the startup was originally called Bloom, and 200 users tested the service in Paris already.<\/p>\n<p>And everybody will be able to sign up and get a bike starting in April 2022. The startup will compete with other bike subscription services, such as German startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/08\/e-bike-subscription-service-dance-adds-new-cities-and-mopeds\/\">Dance<\/a>, Netherlands company <a href=\"https:\/\/swapfiets.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Swapfiets<\/a> and publicly funded service <a href=\"https:\/\/www.veligo-location.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">V\u00e9ligo<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>More importantly, the startup competes with public transportation, bike-sharing schemes and buying your own electric bike. The bike-as-a-service model provides many advantages.<\/p>\n<p>First, you don\u2019t have to pay a large sum of money upfront. Second, many bike owners don\u2019t want to get an electric bike because of thefts. Third, many people want to make sure they can actually use a bike to commute before buying one.<\/p>\n<p>For all these reasons, it\u2019s good to see that bike-as-a-service represents another interesting option to get started with bikes. I still believe that we\u2019re at the very start of the urban mobility revolution and people will end up using different transportation methods to get from point A to point B \u2014 especially in European cities. And many people should consider services like Motto to add an electric bike to their personal transportation mix.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ZK9t0H3VXz\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/20\/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars\/\">How four European cities are embracing micromobility to drive out cars<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How four European cities are embracing micromobility to drive out cars&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/20\/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars\/embed\/#?secret=LNIIT686qF#?secret=ZK9t0H3VXz\" data-secret=\"ZK9t0H3VXz\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meet Motto, a new French startup that plans to offer electric bikes in Paris.

department\u2019s best friend by managing hardware as a service. Fleet clients can rent computers and smartphones for a flat monthly fee. If there\u2019s a hardware issue, the startup handles returns and repairs.<\/p>\n<p>And when it\u2019s time to renew, Fleet can exchange old corporate laptops and smartphones for new ones. Customers can see their current fleet of devices in a single admin interface.<\/p>\n<p>The company offers a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fleet.co\/en\/location-ordinateurs\/tarifs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wide range of devices<\/a>. For instance, a 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro chip and 16GB of RAM currently costs \u20ac99.90 per device per month. The M1 MacBook Air starts at \u20ac54.90 per device per month. An iPhone 13 with 128GB of storage will cost you \u20ac44.90 per month.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2283465\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>You can also find Microsoft laptops (Surface Laptop Go, Surface Laptop 4 and Surface Pro 7), Dell computers and even a couple of Chromebooks. When a device is reaching its end of life and is sent back to Fleet, the company gives it to a nonprofit organization, sells it to a refurbishment company or recycles it.<\/p>\n<p>Fleet is a bootstrapped startup and hasn\u2019t raised any VC funding. But it\u2019s been growing nicely as the company is expected to generate an annual turnover of $13.1 million (\u20ac12 million) at its current run rate.<\/p>\n<p>It currently has 600 clients including some well-known French startups, such as Ankorstore, Ornikar, Sunday, Matera, Cubyn, Wemaintain and Shine. And today, the company is launching its device-as-a-service offering in Spain. The company is going to open an office in Barcelona as well.<\/p>\n<p>There are more European expansions on the road map as many of Fleet\u2019s suppliers can deliver across Europe already. The company is looking at Portugal, Italy, Germany and Belgium for its next markets.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Many companies choose to buy devices for their employees directly. But there\u2019s a big upfront cost and it means that you don\u2019t have any supplier that can help you in case of hardware issues.<\/p>\n<p>Companies have been looking at ways to turn these big capital expenditures into operating costs. For instance, a company could negotiate a credit line with their bank to buy hardware.<\/p>\n<p>And this is key to understanding Fleet\u2019s business model. The startup negotiates directly with financial partners and leasing companies so that Fleet clients just have to create an account and submit some documents. They can order some laptops in just a few minutes.

The startup has raised a $4.5 million seed round led by <a href=\"http:\/\/amplovc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amplo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/ribbitcap.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ribbit Capital<\/a>. Robinhood\u2019s founders Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt also invested in the company. Webull\u2019s Anquan Wang is an investor as well.<\/p>\n<p>The startup is launching a handful of corridors at first. More specifically, users who sign up today can send money from the U.K. in GBP into nine currencies \u2014 USD, EUR, AUD, CAD, SEK, NOK, DKK, PLN and CZK. When it comes to payment methods, Atlantic Money currently focuses on local bank transfers. Standard transfers take two to three business days while express transfers should arrive within a day.<\/p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, the company partners with several large financial institutions that can provide a good foreign exchange rate. Atlantic Money picks the best rate and doesn\u2019t add any markup fee. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see if Atlantic Money can provide better rates than its competitors.<\/p>\n<p>At the time of writing, when you try to transfer \u00a35,000 to the U.S., it currently costs \u00a317.79 in fees on Wise \u2014 you receive $6,648.51. With a free Revolut account, you pay \u00a320.96 in fees in addition to the \u00a35,000 you want to convert. However, the exchange rate is slightly better as you receive around $6,700 in exchange for \u00a35,020.96.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, Revolut provides other services, such as bank accounts, cards, the ability to trade stocks and cryptocurrencies, etc. You can pay \u00a36.99 per month for a premium account and waive fees on currency exchange. However, it\u2019s a 12-month plan, so you may end up paying more in subscription fees than in FX fees depending on your Revolut usage.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, Wise lets you generate local account details in a dozen countries, which could be useful to get paid in a country where you don\u2019t live. Wise also tries to make transfers as quick as possible \u2014 45% of Wise transfers <a href=\"https:\/\/wise.com\/gb\/blog\/mission-update-q4-2021-speed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">arrive<\/a> in 20 seconds or less.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, there is room for more than just one foreign exchange product. It\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all industry. Customers will end up picking a service depending on the corridor they use most often, their average transfer size and the additional features they might need. But if you just want to move large amounts from the U.K. to Europe or Northern America, you could potentially become an Atlantic Money user.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2281215\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2281215\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2281215\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Atlantic-Money-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"613\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Atlantic-Money-1.jpeg 1270w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Atlantic-Money-1.jpeg?resize=150,90 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Atlantic-Money-1.jpeg?resize=300,180 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Atlantic-Money-1.jpeg?resize=768,460 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Atlantic-Money-1.jpeg?resize=680,407 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Atlantic-Money-1.jpeg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2281215\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Atlantic Money<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meet Atlantic Money, a foreign exchange startup that plans to be cheaper than other foreign exchange services.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/27\/dance-raises-another-19-4-million-for-its-e-bike-subscription-service\/\">nearly $20 million<\/a> a few months ago, Berlin-based startup <a href=\"https:\/\/dance.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dance<\/a> is expanding its electric bike subscription service to a handful of new cities. In addition to Berlin, people living in Hamburg, Munich, Vienna and Paris will be able to rent an e-bike for a fixed monthly price.<\/p>\n<p>Dance isn\u2019t just another e-bike manufacturer; the company designed e-bikes specifically to rent to customers. The Dance One has integrated lights, a carbon belt, hydraulic discs and a smartphone mount on the handlebar. You can unlock the battery to charge it at home without having to bring your bike inside.<\/p>\n<p>Customers can reserve their own Dance bike for \u20ac79 per month, which includes both theft protection and repairs. When there\u2019s something wrong with your bike, you can schedule a repair over the next 24 hours. That\u2019s part of the reason why Dance is limited to a handful of cities.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2281459\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The startup doesn\u2019t plan to stop at e-bikes, though. The company\u2019s goal is to accelerate urban mobility changes with a complete offering. That\u2019s why Dance has quietly acquired <a href=\"https:\/\/rollich.de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rollich<\/a>, an electric moped leasing company based in Berlin. Terms of the acquisition remain undisclosed, though Rollich founder Felix Schaar is joining Dance.<\/p>\n<p>Essentially, Dance wants to focus on moving people across cities. Lighter vehicles, such as electric mopeds and bikes, combined with services should help when it comes to congestion and urban pollution.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur goal at Dance has always been to spark a global movement towards creating safer, more livable cities by offering a flexible and convenient way to travel,\u201d co-founder and CEO Eric Quidenus-Wahlforss said in a statement. \u201cNow is the right time: with increased cycling infrastructure, public discourse and political will across Europe to create more sustainable cities, we can help more people choose a more sustainable commute.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2281463\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2281463\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2281463\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Moped_Perspective.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Moped_Perspective.png 3840w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Moped_Perspective.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Moped_Perspective.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Moped_Perspective.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Moped_Perspective.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Moped_Perspective.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Moped_Perspective.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Moped_Perspective.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2281463\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Dance<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Dance is partnering with NIU for its mopeds. It sounds like Dance is mostly rebranding existing NIU mopeds and integrating them with its service. Mopeds will only be available in Germany for now.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s another new vehicle in the lineup, as you can see in the photo at the top of the article, which looks like an ad for car-free cities with a car-ad budget. Dance is introducing a low-step variant of its electric bike. It works pretty much like its existing e-bike, but with a different frame that&#8217;s more suitable for shorter people.<\/p>\n<p>While Dance originally focused on no-commitment plans, customers can now choose to pay for a yearly subscription and get a small rebate.<\/p>\n<p>E-bikes now cost \u20ac79 per month, or \u20ac59 per month if you\u2019re willing to pay for a yearly subscription. Mopeds cost \u20ac119 per month, or \u20ac89 per month with a 12-month plan. Right now, plans are a bit cheaper due to introductory prices.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, Dance wants to address the B2B market with a new Dance for Business offering. This service isn\u2019t designed for quick-commerce or food delivery companies. Instead, companies can leverage Dance for Business to offer the option to get an e-bike as an employee benefit.<\/p>\n<p>This is a smart move as many companies already pay for public transportation passes. The ability to choose between a public transportation pass and an e-bike would be nice for many employees.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2281461\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2281461\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2281461\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Lowstep_Side0.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Lowstep_Side0.png 3840w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Lowstep_Side0.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Lowstep_Side0.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Lowstep_Side0.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Lowstep_Side0.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Lowstep_Side0.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Lowstep_Side0.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/dance_Lowstep_Side0.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2281461\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Dance<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After raising nearly $20 million a few months ago, Berlin-based startup Dance is expanding its electric bike subscription service to a handful of new cities.
