Mac Studio review: emerging from the Mac’s midlife crisis
It's pretty, it's powerful, it's pricey and it's pretty much everything you want in a Mac desktop


Brian Heater @bheater / 2 weeks







The rumor mill nailed most of the announcements in the lead up to last week’s event. But in an era when so much of consumer hardware has grown samey, Apple still managed to surprise. In the grand scheme of event unveils, the Mac Studio wasn’t a huge curveball, exactly, so much as the last sign of a company continuing to evolve its personal computer strategy. Nearly a half-century after the arrival of the first Apple computer, the category still has some life left in it yet.
Just a few years ago, I wouldn’t have felt confident in that statement. The Mac was very much undergoing a midlife crisis. The iPhone had rocketed to the top of the list both in terms of Apple mind and revenue share, and the iPad soaked up what was left. When it came to innovation, macOS was seemingly stuck with reheated leftovers from its mobile counterpart.
On the hardware side, meanwhile, it seemed the company had abandoned the professional creative category that once formed a key segment of its base, leaving room for products like Microsoft’s Surface line to blossom in its wake. It attempted to reignite some excitement around the addition of the Touchbar, but eventually even Apple had to give up the ghost, quietly phasing out that strange experiment.

The Macs of a few years ago suffered from bad keyboards (there were lawsuits) and a lack of ports. The latter was easy enough to chalk up to Apple streamlining, but that didn’t make it sting any less.

But in 2020, the paradigm shifted again. Fittingly, it was yet another direct result of iPhone R&D that brought the change. But this time it wasn’t the addition of some iOS app. In the intervening years, Apple had leapfrogged Mac hardware when it shifted to its own in-house chip development for the iPhone. For most of the company’s existence, it’s preferred to go things alone where possible, and the development of its own first-party silicon has afforded that opportunity in profound new ways.
It was only a matter of time before Apple followed suit on the Mac. The company wound down the first year of the pandemic by debuting the M1 chip — and with it, a trio of new Macs: the MacBook Air, Pro and Mini. The reviews were near unanimous: the Mac was back — at least from a performance perspective. As anyone who has ever remodeled a house or redesigned a website can tell you, teardowns take time, and that first round of M1 felt like a new engine in an old body.

Last May, Apple released a new 24-inch iMac, which brought the new silicon to a new design — the first fundamental rebuild of its all-in-one in around a decade and a half. That’s a lifetime or two in this world. I don’t use the word “cute” a lot to refer to hardware devices. Cute is for bunny rabbits and babies. But also the 2021 iMac. Cute, but powerful. I’ve been using the desktop as my daily driver for the better part of a year (I don’t leave my apartment like I used to), and I’ve never had any moments that felt like I’d pushed the M1 beyond its limits.

Assuming 24-inches is enough screen real estate for you, I can still heartily recommend the iMac for most users — especially for those, like me, who have space constraints. Really, my only issue on that front is going with the yellow.
All of that said, if I had to choose, I believe I would pinpoint last October as the real birth of the modern Mac. Hear me out on this one. More than just new hardware, the last MacBook Pro presents a new approach to hardware. I don’t think I’m talking out of school when I say that Apple has frequently been so single-mindedly focused on its own design decisions that public opinion can get steamrolled in the process. Read one of Devin’s impassioned essays on the iPhone SE, and you’ll see what I mean. Losing beloved features. Sometimes it’s in the name of progress and sometimes for the sake of aesthetics, but it’s always hard.
Last year’s Pro felt different. Our jaded staff was suitably excited when it was revealed. After years of withholding, it was a Mac that felt as uncompromising as the new M1 Pro and Max chips that powered it. It was an easy recommendation for Mac users, with none of the misgivings that had dotted other recent Mac releases.
So, where does the Mac Studio fall in all of this? It’s a bit more complicated than it appears at first blush. For one thing, as I noted up top, the product’s entry was a surprise. On the desktop front, the 27-inch iMac felt like a sure bet as recently as last week. The product would be a step up from last year’s all-in-one and fill the void left by the iMac Pro — a product, which in hindsight, was a stop gap as the company worked out its M1 roadmap and righted the shaky ship the Mac Pro had become.

Will there be a 27-inch iMac? Most likely, no. Reports suggest that one isn’t imminent, and frankly, there’s probably too much overlap with the Mac Studio. With last year’s model, the iMac effectively returned to its rightful place as Apple’s entry-level desktop — albeit a quite powerful one, as that bar rose across the line with the arrival of M1. Its color scheme certainly places it in the proud tradition of products like the iPod and iPhone Mini.

Pricing, too, is a bit more complicated than it appears at first blush. The M1 Mac Mini currently starts at $699, whereas the iMac M1 starts at $1,299. The Mac Studio, meanwhile, starts at $1,999 — effectively the price of the two products combined. Where things get a bit more complicated is that the iMac is the only device of the three that comes with its own display baked in. The upshot of that is that you don’t necessarily need to go with a first-party display, if you want to save some cash or have a perfectly good screen lying around.

For the sake of this review, of course, we’re including the Studio Display, because it’s the one that Apple sent us. That’s going to add another $1,599 to your starting tab, which brings us to ~$3,600. Pretty soon we’re going to be talking about real money here. As tested, we’re talking about the M1 Max here — with the 32-core GPU, 64GB RAM and 1TB of storage, putting us at $2,799. Want the M1 Ultra? That starts at $3,999 and goes up to $7,999. At that price point, however, we’re discussing the needs of <.1% of Mac users here (not an actual number, mind).

Predictably, the system performed comparably to last year’s M1 Max Pro in GeekBench. It scored 1790/12851 on the Apple Silicon test, versus the MacBook’s 1781/12674 and 1337/9975 to the laptop’s 1348/9949 on the Intel version. It edged out the MacBook in the GFXBench Metal test, as well, at 307 to its 279.6. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to get our hands on the Ultra chip, but the results were extremely impressive here, nonetheless.

What’s even more impressive is the Studio was able to perform what would have been an extremely resource-intensive task on an Intel model without so much as firing up the fan or even getting warm to the touch, really.

After Apple one-more-thinged the Mac Pro at last week’s event, you’ve got to wonder where the company is going from here. The M2 chip? Perhaps, but even so, there aren’t a ton of people who need to, say render a full Pixar film or develop really high-end VR content. Those people do exist, of course, and there will be increasingly more of them, moving forward. And hey, even more so than laptops, it’s important to future-proof these devices. You’re going to want a $3,000 desktop to last a while.
Like the new Pro, there are fewer tradeoffs here than, say, on the Mac Mini. First and foremost is ports. Ports are important. They let your things connect to other things. The Studio sports a pair of USB-C ports in the front, along with an SD reader. The latter, in particular, is one you interact with frequently, so it’s handy having it up front. Around the other side are two more USB-Cs, two USB-As (something I’ve missed on the iMac), ethernet, a headphone jack and HDMI out (but not in). Add in the Studio Display and you get another four ports.

Even more so than the Studio itself, the Studio Display fills an important hole in the Apple lineup. Keep in mind, Apple completely got out of the first-party display game for some time before the arrival of the $5,000 Pro Display XDR. Like the Mac Pro or M1 Ultra, Pro Display XDR is more monitor than most people will need. If you’re keen to get a first-party Apple monitor, the 27-inch, 5K Retina Apple Studio Display is plenty of screen for most. For another $300, the anti-reflective coating, coupled with nano textured glass, dramatically reduces glare, which is nice for pro and non-pro users, alike.

iMac 2021 mic test


https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mac-Studio-Audio.m4a

Mac Studio 2022 mic test
The mic quality is good — Apple’s positioning them as “studio quality,” but if you’re planning to do much more than just webconferencing, I’d recommend plugging an external mic into one of the aforementioned ports. Among other things, that will afford you the ability to get in much tighter. The speakers have fuller sound than the most recent iMac, owing in part to the wider, thicker frame that allows for more surface area for the down-firing grilles.

Clockwise from top left: iMac 2020, iMac 2021, Opal C1 external webcam, Mac Studio
The biggest disappointment here from the AV perspective is undoubtedly the webcam. Center Stage does a good job tracking, but the image is a surprising step down from recent M1 Macs. The white balance is off and there’s more image noise. My first instinct was to try to peel away a protective film I might have left on by accident, but to no avail. That’s just how the image is now — a pretty huge disappointment for a monitor that starts at $1,599.
That’s exacerbated by the company’s recent insistence that users won’t need an external webcam with the new Macs, after a focus first on the M1’s ISP and then subsequent updates to the camera itself. The above image should make it evident why — for now, at least, I’m sticking with the external camera for my work interviews and podcast (the shots were taking under similar lighting conditions, but note that the Opal flips the image by default). I will happily give it another go after a fix is pushed.

The camera module is effectively the same as the one found on the new iPad, and hopefully it’s something the company will be able to fix with a system update. So much of the tuning in these systems happens on the software side. Matthew has spent some time with the Studio, as well, and will be discussing it as part of a larger forthcoming piece on the hardware (we’ll link back it’s live). Quoting, in part,

In our testing, the Studio Display‘s camera produces grainy, low contrast and generally poor images both locally and remotely. The images that we’re seeing are, at this time, worse than the 2021 24″ iMac’s camera produces.
I noticed the quality issues as soon as I fired up the webcam for the first time. I checked it with other devices, and noticed that it was actually slightly better if it was running from a MacBook Pro running MacOS 12.2, though still not great. Given that there was a difference, my assumption was that it appeared to be some sort of processing error. I asked Apple if the results I had were typical, and sent sample images and video of what I was seeing. After review, an Apple spokesperson told me that the system was not behaving as expected and that Apple would be making updates to address the camera’s performance.
I do not have a timeline or any specifics on those updates, but Apple is now aware there is an issue with the Studio Display’s camera quality and they said they are working on fixes. It’s worth knowing this going into making your purchasing decisions, and could be a reason to wait to see if those updates improve the quality.
As of now, it does not live up to the otherwise excellent performance of the display itself and the speakers, which set a new standard for in-monitor audio.

In a world where Apple is starting to pay more attention to right-to-repair concerns and broadening its focus on sustainability, user repairability feels like a missed opportunity. The ability to lift the case off and clean the fan from the inside and replace parts would likely go a ways for many users. Though Apple isn’t quite ready to make that commitment on that front. Users are going to have to bring this one into an Apple authorized shop if/when that time comes. That means that modularity and upgradability are likely to be a big distinguishing factor when the Mac Pro arrives, perhaps at WWDC.

As with the iMac, the Studio looks great on a desktop. The computer’s industrial design most closely resembles a taller Mac Mini, with the same rounded corners and brushed aluminum. Like the best-designed Macs, it’s industrial, but not cold, and looks striking next to the Studio Display, which sits atop a matching aluminum stand. There are additional stand options, which allow for adjustable height ($2,299) and a Vesta Mount adapter, which lets you tilt it into portrait mode, which I know at least one TechCrunch editor would kill for as a second Tweetdeck monitor.
And you can really go hog wild on that front, with support for up to five monitors (four over USB-C and one 4K via the HDMI). Even if you’re not in the habit of hooking five screens up to your Mac, things still up up quickly. As configured, our Studio runs $2,799. Add in the $1,899 display (gotta have that nano-textured glass) and we’re talking ~$4,700. Then maybe add in the new black keyboard with Touch ID and number pad and mouse/trackpad ($99/$149). It’s not for the faint of heart or the thin of wallet.
It’s a few hundred more than the last Intel-based 27-inch iMac I tested, and about the same as a standalone Pro Display XDR. Hey, everything is relative, right?
Apple is no doubt kicking itself for missing the beginning of the work from home push. If the new iMac and Mac Studio would have been available in early or mid-2020, the company would have made a killing. But, then, for many folks there may never be a return to the office. For most users, I would still go with the iMac. If you edit video, music or other resource-intensive creative pursuits and have a larger budget, however, this is a terrific machine. The Mac Pro is the last question mark in the line at the moment, but the new Studio is plenty of machine for most prospective buyers.

Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in late February, Delfast\u2019s top priority has been to see its Ukrainian team of 30 safely evacuated from the most dangerous parts of the country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n When not focusing on sales, marketing, R&D and customer support, Delfast\u2019s smaller team of seven employees based in Los Angeles has been pleading with U.S. politicians and the European Commission to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and fighter jets that could help Ukraine gain back some control over its air space, and, hopefully, put a stop to this war.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Delfast\u2019s co-founders, Daniel Tonkopi and Serhiy Denysenko, say they have always believed in safeguarding the future. When they founded Delfast in 2014, originally as a delivery company, Tonkoply and Denysenko knew that providing couriers with green transportation options would be critical to the company\u2019s operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n \t \n\t\t \n\t\t\tThe most important thing for an entrepreneur, and in general for any leader, is to protect the team and be completely honest with them during a tough time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Tonkopi, co-founder of Delfast<\/cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/span><\/p>\n The founders soon realized that a bike with the power, range and battery life their couriers needed didn\u2019t exist, and so they set out to build one. In 2017, backed by a Kickstarter campaign that saw the company raise $165,000, the startup began manufacturing a bike to fit its needs \u2013 one that promptly <\/span>won the Guinness Book of World Records<\/span><\/a> for the greatest distance traveled on an electric motorbike on a single charge.<\/span><\/p>\n More recently, the Delfast Top 3.0 e-motorbike <\/span>won Forbes\u2019 fastest e-bike of the year<\/span><\/a> in 2022 after the company announced some serious <\/span>upgrades to the vehicle during CES<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n We spoke with Delfast\u2019s co-founders to discuss what it\u2019s like running a startup during a war, how the startup is considering breaking into new business verticals, and the importance of always having a Plan B.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n Note: Serhiy Denysenko\u2019s answers were translated from Ukrainian by a member of Delfast\u2019s team for TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n TC: Serhiy, you’re on the ground in Kyiv. What’s your day-to-day like?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues. It\u2019s important to keep in touch and know that everyone is fine, or as fine as is possible right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Besides my work as a COO, I\u2019ve been helping with volunteering, getting supplies and medicine to people, and this is something that pretty much every Ukrainian is now doing. I had my family relocated to Hungary, so I feel more or less safe, and I\u2019m just trying to work as much as possible and do my best in every possible area, whether that\u2019s supporting the company or supporting Ukraine in general.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n How are you managing your team through this crisis? What\u2019s changed?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>We got used to working remotely during Coronavirus times, so we have our task tracker, where everyone can see his or her task. Every Monday, we have an online Zoom meeting. Previously we only had these meetings at the executive level, but now during the war, we are gathering all together, just to see each other\u2019s faces and ask how they\u2019re doing, how\u2019s everyone feeling. Just to talk with everybody.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n <\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":" “Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues.

But second, and more immediately relevant in this case, you would not know that there is a technique to it that, surprisingly, robots aren’t super good at because they tend to be… crushy. But this robo-berry<\/a> designed by Swiss researchers could usher in a new era of gentle, automated robo-pickers.<\/p>\n The secret to picking a raspberry is to grip it just enough to get purchase and then pull it downwards off the little stem, apparently called the “receptacle,” which seems backwards. Seems simple \u2014 and it is, but only our hands are among the most sensitive and finely controlled constructions in the universe, the culmination of a hundred million years of evolution, outdone only by (I suspect) raccoons.<\/p>\n Robots simply don’t have the senses necessary to figure out the perfect technique for picking a berry. But what if it could communicate with the berry to better sense the forces involved and avoid either a a brutal crushing or humiliating failure-to-detach?<\/p> <\/div>\n That’s what Kai Junge, a PhD student at EPFL in Switzerland, aims to accomplish with this “sensorized raspberry,” a silicone and silicon replica berry that provides feedback to the picking machine, allowing it to learn to pick faster and better \u2014 and cleaner.<\/p>\n “It\u2019s an exciting dilemma for us as robotics engineers,” said professor Josie Hughes, who worked with Junge on the project. “The raspberry harvesting season is so short, and the fruit is so valuable, that wasting them simply isn’t an option. What’s more, the cost and logistical challenges of testing different options out in the field are prohibitive. That\u2019s why we decided to run our tests in the lab and develop a replica raspberry for training harvesting robots.”<\/p>\n Apparently the hard part comes just at the moment of detaching, when the force needed to grip the berry on the receptacle suddenly becomes overkill as the object goes from solid to hollow.<\/p>\n The replica berry has a fluidic sensor that tells the system how much compression is being experienced by the silicone drooplets, allowing the control model to learn how to adjust its grip as if the berry itself is telling it how much is too much.<\/p>\n You can see the berry in action below:<\/p>\n <\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The team plans to present their work at RobotSoft in April. And once the raspberry question is decided, they may move on to other berries, tomatoes, grapes&#8230; even apricots.

Riley Principal to access over the next few weeks if certain conditions are met, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Swvl was founded by <a href=\"https:\/\/eg.linkedin.com\/in\/mostafa-kandil-57761032\">Mostafa Kandil<\/a>, Mahmoud Nouh and Ahmed Sabbah in 2017. The trio started the company as a bus-hailing service in Egypt and other ride-sharing services in emerging markets with fragmented public transportation.<\/p>\n<p>Its bus-hailing services enable users to make intra-state journeys by booking seats on buses running a fixed route. Swvl offerings have expanded beyond bus-hailing services, though. Now, the company offers inter-city rides, car ride-sharing, and corporate services in the 10 cities it operates in across Africa and the Middle East.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The partnership between Swvl and Queen\u2019s Gambit came from a mutual interest from both parties<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While searching for a company to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acquire<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl fit the blank-check company\u2019s criteria: strong business fundamentals, mobility and logistics (one of its core verticals), and an ESG ethos around women and affordable transportation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl &#8212; off the back of raising over $170 million in venture capital, expanding to over 16 countries across Latin America, Asia and Africa; hiring executives from Facebook, Uber and Optimus; and acquiring Shotl, Viapool and door2door &#8212; was on a quest for global dominance in the mobility space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A SPAC with Queen\u2019s Gambit was the most suitable option for it from a financial standpoint, and both parties feel strongly about the sustainability angle around transport &#8212; Swvl claims it has prevented approximately 289 million pounds of carbon emissions since its inception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company plans to expand into several countries over the next six months, including Colombia, Mexico, South Africa, and the U.S. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, all eyes will be on the company\u2019s performance as it <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">officially<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starts trading tomorrow in a cooling SPAC market and a generally unsettled public market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s a softness in the market, but as long as the company operates and delivers results, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maybe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today, people don\u2019t pay attention to it, but they will in months ahead,\u201d Grace said about the worrying SPAC and public markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the market will change <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like it always does and people go back to fundamentals at how we look at company\u2019s performances. For Swvl, they have been beating every single number that was ever presented to us. And that\u2019s what makes me super excited about this.

But with Minit, the tech giant is doubling down on a software category that could be worth over $11 billion by 2030, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wfmz.com\/news\/pr_newswire\/pr_newswire_technology\/global-process-mining-software-market-size-value-estimated-to-reach-usd-11-096-7-million\/article_a95b3354-ec2f-5389-b761-e4dbbdadbb97.html#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20report%20published,forecast%20period%202022%20to%202030.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according<\/a> to a report from Polaris Market Research.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292372\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear whether the whole of the Minit team will join Microsoft &#8212; or, indeed, whether the company will remain spread across its current locations. (Minit is now headquartered in Amsterdam, with satellite offices in London and New York.) But CEO James Dening said that customers shouldn&#8217;t expect a change in the level of support they&#8217;re currently receiving.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to what it means to become part of an industry leader like Microsoft and what that brings us &#8212; how we can use that scale and excellence to continue to deliver great solutions to our customers,&#8221; Dening wrote in a blog <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minit.io\/blog\/microsoft-minit-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post<\/a> on Minit&#8217;s website. &#8220;It has been a privilege to lead the company for the last year, and I\u2019m excited to continue my journey with the team, as part of what I consider to be the world\u2019s leading software company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Microsoft spokesperson Zara Huang told TechCrunch that the Minit team will move into the\u00a0<span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> Process Insights team and that there will be &#8220;no change&#8221; to the current work location of Minit team members. <span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> is in early stages of determining how Minit will be integrated into its offerings, she said, and the companies will share more details when they&#8217;re available.<\/p>\n<p>Minit, which was founded in 2015 by Rasto Hlavac and had raised \u20ac10.3 million (~$11.40 million) prior to the acquisition, is one of an expanding number of startups developing process mining tools aimed at enterprise clientele. Process mining, also known as task discovery, involves spotting root cause workflow issues and bottlenecks by pulling data from systems including desktop, email apps and workflows. It&#8217;s a key part of robotic process automation (RPA), a technology that promises to automate monotonous, repetitive tasks traditionally performed by human workers while at the same time generating logs to identify potential cost savings.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As Protocol&#8217;s Aisha Counts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/bulletins\/microsoft-process-mining-minit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notes<\/a>, process mining has traditionally been done by system integrators who map out processes by analyzing manual workflows. Process mining software is designed to digitize the approach in a way that reduces the expense, time and effort involved.<\/p>\n<p>Underlining the appetite for process mining technologies, Celonis, a data processing company, earlier this week acquired Minit competitor Process Analytics Factory, which coincidentally integrates with Microsoft&#8217;s Power BI analytics platform. Just in the past several years, RPA vendor Automation Anywhere acquired process discovery and mining startups FortressIQ, Process Gold\\ and StepShot; Blue Prism released a task mining solution called Capture; and rivals including ABBYY and Kryon have expanded their process mining offerings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/\">Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=wqSRCOP7wQ#?secret=2NKiKfcj0k\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;You know the process space is hot when even Microsoft, with its vast resources, has to buy its way in.

SAP acquired German process automation company Signavio in January 2021, just before ServiceNow got into the RPA segment with the buyout of India-based Intellibot.io.

been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robotics-roundup-12\/\">focused on pizza<\/a>. I\u2019ve long posited that this is for two key reasons. First: People like pizza. We eat a lot of it. Americans alone eat three billion pizzas a year. Second: It\u2019s relatively easy to make. The dough provides a fairly straightforward platform onto which ingredients are added.<\/p>\n<p>I say \u201cfairly\u201d here because there are still complications. There\u2019s really no such thing as easy when it comes to building robots that can execute variations on a task at a large scale. Here it\u2019s the dough that presents the problem. Turning a soft and malleable ball of dough into a pizza crust is one of those things humans have figured out how to do efficiently, but it still proves difficult for robot workers.<\/p>\n<p>A team of researchers at MIT, CMU and UC San Diego set out to create what they\u2019ve deemed \u201ccomplex dough-manipulation.\u201d The system is separated into a two-step process, in which the robot must first determine the task and then execute it using a tool like a rolling pin. The system, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2022\/robotic-deformable-object-0331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DiffSkill<\/a>, involves teaching robots complex tasks in simulations.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292473\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>MIT notes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A \u201cteacher\u201d algorithm solves each step the robot must take to complete the task. Then, it trains a \u201cstudent\u201d machine-learning model that learns abstract ideas about when and how to execute each skill it needs during the task, like using a rolling pin. With this knowledge, the system reasons about how to execute the skills to complete the entire task.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The researchers say the system outperformed those trained in the more traditional reinforcement learning model. \u201cOur framework provides a novel way for robots to acquire new skills. These skills can then be chained to solve more complex tasks which are beyond the capability of previous robot systems,\u201d says CSAIL grad student, Yunzhu Li.<\/p>\n<p>This is robotics, so the whole pizza thing is really an initial problem for a system designed to tackle a lot more tasks. The company points to the emerging field of eldercare robotics as a possible use going forward.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A disproportionate number of the early industrial food-making robots we\u2019ve seen have been focused on pizza.

Studio review: emerging from the Mac&#8217;s midlife crisis"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">The rumor mill<\/span> nailed most of the announcements in the lead up to last week\u2019s event. But in an era when so much of consumer hardware has grown samey, Apple still managed to surprise. In the grand scheme of event unveils, the Mac Studio wasn\u2019t a huge curveball, exactly, so much as the last sign of a company continuing to evolve its personal computer strategy. Nearly a half-century after the arrival of the first Apple computer, the category still has some life left in it yet.<\/p>\n<p>Just a few years ago, I wouldn\u2019t have felt confident in that statement. The Mac was very much undergoing a midlife crisis. The iPhone had rocketed to the top of the list both in terms of Apple mind and revenue share, and the iPad soaked up what was left. When it came to innovation, macOS was seemingly stuck with reheated leftovers from its mobile counterpart.<\/p>\n<p>On the hardware side, meanwhile, it seemed the company had abandoned the professional creative category that once formed a key segment of its base, leaving room for products like Microsoft\u2019s Surface line to blossom in its wake. It attempted to reignite some excitement around the addition of the Touchbar, but eventually even Apple had to give up the ghost, quietly phasing out that strange experiment.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2285724\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The Macs of a few years ago suffered from bad keyboards (there were lawsuits) and a lack of ports. The latter was easy enough to chalk up to Apple streamlining, but that didn\u2019t make it sting any less.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284057\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284057\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2284057 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0978.jpg\" alt=\"Apple iMac studio display computer desktop 2022 set up with keyboard, mouse track\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0978.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0978.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0978.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0978.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0978.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0978.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0978.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0978.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284057\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>But in 2020, the paradigm shifted again. Fittingly, it was yet another direct result of iPhone R&amp;D that brought the change. But this time it wasn\u2019t the addition of some iOS app. In the intervening years, Apple had leapfrogged Mac hardware when it shifted to its own in-house chip development for the iPhone. For most of the company\u2019s existence, it\u2019s preferred to go things alone where possible, and the development of its own first-party silicon has afforded that opportunity in profound new ways.<\/p>\n<p>It was only a matter of time before Apple followed suit on the Mac. The company wound down the first year of the pandemic by debuting the M1 chip &#8212; and with it, a trio of new Macs: the MacBook Air, Pro and Mini. The reviews were near unanimous: the Mac was back &#8212; at least from a performance perspective. As anyone who has ever remodeled a house or redesigned a website can tell you, teardowns take time, and that first round of M1 felt like a new engine in an old body.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Last May, Apple released a new 24-inch iMac, which brought the new silicon to a new design &#8212; the first fundamental rebuild of its all-in-one in around a decade and a half. That\u2019s a lifetime or two in this world. I don\u2019t use the word \u201ccute\u201d a lot to refer to hardware devices. Cute is for bunny rabbits and babies. But also the 2021 iMac. Cute, but powerful. I\u2019ve been using the desktop as my daily driver for the better part of a year (I don\u2019t leave my apartment like I used to), and I\u2019ve never had any moments that felt like I\u2019d pushed the M1 beyond its limits.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284059\" style=\"width: 6730px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284059\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2284059 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0992.jpg\" alt=\"Close up of iMac studio display desktop computer 2022\" width=\"6720\" height=\"4480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0992.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0992.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0992.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0992.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0992.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0992.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0992.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0992.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284059\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Assuming 24-inches is enough screen real estate for you, I can still heartily recommend the iMac for most users &#8212; especially for those, like me, who have space constraints. Really, my only issue on that front is going with the yellow.<\/p>\n<p>All of that said, if I had to choose, I believe I would pinpoint last October as the real birth of the modern Mac. Hear me out on this one. More than just new hardware, the<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/25\/apple-14-inch-macbook-pro-2021-review\/\"> last MacBook Pro<\/a> presents a new approach to hardware. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m talking out of school when I say that Apple has frequently been so single-mindedly focused on its own design decisions that public opinion can get steamrolled in the process. Read one of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/09\/touch-id-forever-face-id-never\/\">Devin\u2019s impassioned essays<\/a> on the iPhone SE, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Losing beloved features. Sometimes it\u2019s in the name of progress and sometimes for the sake of aesthetics, but it\u2019s always hard.<\/p>\n<p>Last year\u2019s Pro felt different. Our jaded staff was suitably excited when it was revealed. After years of withholding, it was a Mac that felt as uncompromising as the new M1 Pro and Max chips that powered it. It was an easy recommendation for Mac users, with none of the misgivings that had dotted other recent Mac releases.<\/p>\n<p>So, where does the Mac Studio fall in all of this? It\u2019s a bit more complicated than it appears at first blush. For one thing, as I noted up top, the product\u2019s entry was a surprise. On the desktop front, the 27-inch iMac felt like a sure bet as recently as last week. The product would be a step up from last year\u2019s all-in-one and fill the void left by the iMac Pro &#8212; a product, which in hindsight, was a stop gap as the company worked out its M1 roadmap and righted the shaky ship the Mac Pro had become.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284044\" style=\"width: 6730px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284044\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2284044 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0957.jpg\" alt=\"Back of iMac desktop studio display 2022\" width=\"6720\" height=\"4480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0957.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0957.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0957.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0957.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0957.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0957.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0957.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0957.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284044\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Will there be a 27-inch iMac?

Its color scheme certainly places it in the proud tradition of products like the iPod and iPhone Mini.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284042\" style=\"width: 6730px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284042\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2284042 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0948.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Mac Studio 2022, image from the back\" width=\"6720\" height=\"4480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0948.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0948.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0948.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0948.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0948.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0948.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0948.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0948.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284042\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Pricing, too, is a bit more complicated than it appears at first blush. The M1 Mac Mini currently starts at $699, whereas the iMac M1 starts at $1,299. The Mac Studio, meanwhile, starts at $1,999 &#8212; effectively the price of the two products combined. Where things get a bit more complicated is that the iMac is the only device of the three that comes with its own display baked in. The upshot of that is that you don\u2019t necessarily need to go with a first-party display, if you want to save some cash or have a perfectly good screen lying around.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2285926\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2285926\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2285926 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-arm-2022.jpg\" alt=\"Pricing comparison graph with other Apple Mac products from past releases, GeekBench Arm\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-arm-2022.jpg 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-arm-2022.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-arm-2022.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-arm-2022.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-arm-2022.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-arm-2022.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-arm-2022.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-arm-2022.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2285926\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Bryce Durbin\/TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2285924\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2285924\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2285924 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-intel-rosetta-2022.jpg\" alt=\"Pricing comparison graph with other Apple Mac products from the past, GeekBench Intel (Rosetta)\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-intel-rosetta-2022.jpg 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-intel-rosetta-2022.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-intel-rosetta-2022.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-intel-rosetta-2022.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-intel-rosetta-2022.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-intel-rosetta-2022.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-intel-rosetta-2022.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/geekbench-intel-rosetta-2022.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2285924\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Bryce Durbin\/TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>For the sake of this review, of course, we\u2019re including the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/17\/apple-execs-on-developing-mac-studio-and-studio-display-for-the-other-pros\/\">Studio Display<\/a>, because it\u2019s the one that Apple sent us.

At that price point, however, we\u2019re discussing the needs of &lt;.1% of Mac users here (not an actual number, mind).<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2285922\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2285922\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2285922 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/xcode-unzip-time-2022.jpg\" alt=\"Xcode Unzip time comparison with other Apple Mac products from past releases\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/xcode-unzip-time-2022.jpg 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/xcode-unzip-time-2022.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/xcode-unzip-time-2022.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/xcode-unzip-time-2022.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/xcode-unzip-time-2022.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/xcode-unzip-time-2022.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/xcode-unzip-time-2022.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/xcode-unzip-time-2022.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2285922\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Bryce Durbin\/TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2285921\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2285921\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2285921 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/webkit-compile-time-2022.jpg\" alt=\"Webkit Compile Time Apple Mac comparison from previous releases \" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/webkit-compile-time-2022.jpg 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/webkit-compile-time-2022.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/webkit-compile-time-2022.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/webkit-compile-time-2022.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/webkit-compile-time-2022.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/webkit-compile-time-2022.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/webkit-compile-time-2022.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/webkit-compile-time-2022.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2285921\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Bryce Durbin\/TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Predictably, the system performed comparably to last year\u2019s M1 Max Pro in GeekBench.

where the company is going from here. The M2 chip? Perhaps, but even so, there aren\u2019t a ton of people who need to, say render a full Pixar film or develop really high-end VR content. Those people do exist, of course, and there will be increasingly more of them, moving forward. And hey, even more so than laptops, it\u2019s important to future-proof these devices. You\u2019re going to want a $3,000 desktop to last a while.<\/p>\n<p>Like the new Pro, there are fewer tradeoffs here than, say, on the Mac Mini. First and foremost is ports. Ports are important. They let your things connect to other things. The Studio sports a pair of USB-C ports in the front, along with an SD reader. The latter, in particular, is one you interact with frequently, so it\u2019s handy having it up front. Around the other side are two more USB-Cs, two USB-As (something I\u2019ve missed on the iMac), ethernet, a headphone jack and HDMI out (but not in). Add in the Studio Display and you get another four ports.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284039\" style=\"width: 6730px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284039\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2284039 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0940.jpg\" alt=\"four ports of Mac Studio 2022 back of device\" width=\"6720\" height=\"4480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0940.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0940.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0940.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0940.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0940.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0940.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0940.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0940.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284039\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Even more so than the Studio itself, the Studio Display fills an important hole in the Apple lineup. Keep in mind, Apple completely got out of the first-party display game for some time before the arrival of the $5,000 Pro Display XDR. Like the Mac Pro or M1 Ultra, Pro Display XDR is more monitor than most people will need. If you\u2019re keen to get a first-party Apple monitor, the 27-inch, 5K Retina Apple Studio Display is plenty of screen for most. For another $300, the anti-reflective coating, coupled with nano textured glass, dramatically reduces glare, which is nice for pro and non-pro users, alike.<\/p>\n<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('audio');<\/script><![endif]-->\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2285724-1\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio\/mpeg\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/white-noise.m4a?_=1\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/white-noise.m4a\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/white-noise.m4a<\/a><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><em>iMac 2021 mic test<\/em><\/p>\n<p><audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-2285724-2\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio\/mpeg\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Mac-Studio-Audio.m4a?_=2\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Mac-Studio-Audio.m4a\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Mac-Studio-Audio.m4a<\/a><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><em>Mac Studio 2022 mic test<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The mic quality is good &#8212; Apple\u2019s positioning them as \u201cstudio quality,\u201d but if you\u2019re planning to do much more than just webconferencing, I\u2019d recommend plugging an external mic into one of the aforementioned ports. Among other things, that will afford you the ability to get in much tighter.

Center Stage does a good job tracking, but the image is a surprising step down from recent M1 Macs. The white balance is off and there\u2019s more image noise. My first instinct was to try to peel away a protective film I might have left on by accident, but to no avail. That&#8217;s just how the image is now &#8212; a pretty huge disappointment for a monitor that starts at $1,599.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s exacerbated by the company&#8217;s recent insistence that users won&#8217;t need an external webcam with the new Macs, after a focus first on the M1&#8217;s ISP and then subsequent updates to the camera itself. The above image should make it evident why &#8212; for now, at least, I&#8217;m sticking with the external camera for my work interviews and podcast (the shots were taking under similar lighting conditions, but note that the Opal flips the image by default). I will happily give it another go after a fix is pushed.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2281598\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2281598\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2281598 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-overview.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Studio Mac Studio overview\" width=\"1680\" height=\"944\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-overview.jpg 1680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-overview.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-overview.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-overview.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-overview.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-overview.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-overview.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2281598\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The camera module is effectively the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/08\/apple-studio-display\/\">same as the one found on the new iPad<\/a>, and hopefully it\u2019s something the company will be able to fix with a system update. So much of the tuning in these systems happens on the software side.\u00a0 Matthew has spent some time with the Studio, as well, and will be discussing it as part of a larger forthcoming piece on the hardware (we&#8217;ll link back it&#8217;s live). Quoting, in part,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In our testing, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/17\/apple-execs-on-developing-mac-studio-and-studio-display-for-the-other-pros\/\">Studio Display<\/a>&#8216;s camera produces grainy, low contrast and generally poor images both locally and remotely. The images that we&#8217;re seeing are, at this time, worse than the 2021 24&#8243; iMac&#8217;s camera produces.<\/p>\n<p>I noticed the quality issues as soon as I fired up the webcam for the first time. I checked it with other devices, and noticed that it was actually slightly better if it was running from a MacBook Pro running MacOS 12.2, though still not great. Given that there was a difference, my assumption was that it appeared to be some sort of processing error. I asked Apple if the results I had were typical, and sent sample images and video of what I was seeing. After review, an Apple spokesperson told me that the system was not behaving as expected and that Apple would be making updates to address the camera&#8217;s performance.<\/p>\n<p>I do not have a timeline or any specifics on those updates, but Apple is now aware there is an issue with the Studio Display&#8217;s camera quality and they said they are working on fixes. It&#8217;s worth knowing this going into making your purchasing decisions, and could be a reason to wait to see if those updates improve the quality.<\/p>\n<p>As of now, it does not live up to the otherwise excellent performance of the display itself and the speakers, which set a new standard for in-monitor audio.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2281599\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2281599\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2281599 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-environment.jpg\" alt=\"Mac Studio environment overview\" width=\"1680\" height=\"944\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-environment.jpg 1680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-environment.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-environment.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-environment.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-environment.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-environment.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-mac-studio-environment.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2281599\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In a world where Apple is starting to pay more attention to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/17\/beginning-next-year-apple-will-mail-you-parts-and-tools-to-fix-your-iphone-and-mac-at-home\/\">right-to-repair concerns<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/17\/apples-sustainability-focused-impact-accelerator-invites-first-15-black-and-brown-owned-companies\/\">broadening its focus on sustainability<\/a>, user repairability feels like a missed opportunity. The ability to lift the case off and clean the fan from the inside and replace parts would likely go a ways for many users. Though Apple isn\u2019t quite ready to make that commitment on that front. Users are going to have to bring this one into an Apple authorized shop if\/when that time comes. That means that modularity and upgradability are likely to be a big distinguishing factor when the Mac Pro arrives, perhaps at WWDC.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2284043\" style=\"width: 6730px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2284043\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2284043 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0950.jpg\" alt=\"Mac Studio 2022 review of device\" width=\"6720\" height=\"4480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0950.jpg 6720w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0950.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0950.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0950.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0950.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0950.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0950.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/CMC_0950.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2284043\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Brian Heater<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As with the iMac, the Studio looks great on a desktop. The computer\u2019s industrial design most closely resembles a taller Mac Mini, with the same rounded corners and brushed aluminum. Like the best-designed Macs, it\u2019s industrial, but not cold, and looks striking next to the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/17\/apple-execs-on-developing-mac-studio-and-studio-display-for-the-other-pros\/\">Studio Display<\/a>, which sits atop a matching aluminum stand. There are additional stand options, which allow for adjustable height ($2,299) and a Vesta Mount adapter, which lets you tilt it into portrait mode, which I know at least one TechCrunch editor would kill for as a second Tweetdeck monitor.<\/p>\n<p>And you can really go hog wild on that front, with support for up to five monitors (four over USB-C and one 4K via the HDMI). Even if you&#8217;re not in the habit of hooking five screens up to your Mac, things still up up quickly. As configured, our Studio runs $2,799. Add in the $1,899 display (gotta have that nano-textured glass) and we&#8217;re talking ~$4,700. Then maybe add in the new black keyboard with Touch ID and number pad and mouse\/trackpad ($99\/$149). It&#8217;s not for the faint of heart or the thin of wallet.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a few hundred more than the last Intel-based <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/apple-27-inch-imac-review\/\">27-inch iMac<\/a> I tested, and about the same as a standalone Pro Display XDR. Hey, everything is relative, right?<\/p>\n<p>Apple is no doubt kicking itself for missing the beginning of the work from home push. If the new iMac and Mac Studio would have been available in early or mid-2020, the company would have made a killing. But, then, for many folks there may never be a return to the office. For most users, I would still go with the iMac. If you edit video, music or other resource-intensive creative pursuits and have a larger budget, however, this is a terrific machine. The Mac Pro is the last question mark in the line at the moment, but the new Studio is plenty of machine for most prospective buyers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/apple-march-2022-event\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/apple-march-2022-event-banner1.jpg\" alt=\"Read more about the Apple March 2022 event on TechCrunch\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The rumor mill nailed most of the announcements in the lead up to last week\u2019s event.
