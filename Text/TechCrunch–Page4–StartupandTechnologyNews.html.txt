Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in late February, Delfast\u2019s top priority has been to see its Ukrainian team of 30 safely evacuated from the most dangerous parts of the country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n When not focusing on sales, marketing, R&D and customer support, Delfast\u2019s smaller team of seven employees based in Los Angeles has been pleading with U.S. politicians and the European Commission to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and fighter jets that could help Ukraine gain back some control over its air space, and, hopefully, put a stop to this war.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Delfast\u2019s co-founders, Daniel Tonkopi and Serhiy Denysenko, say they have always believed in safeguarding the future. When they founded Delfast in 2014, originally as a delivery company, Tonkoply and Denysenko knew that providing couriers with green transportation options would be critical to the company\u2019s operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n \t \n\t\t \n\t\t\tThe most important thing for an entrepreneur, and in general for any leader, is to protect the team and be completely honest with them during a tough time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Tonkopi, co-founder of Delfast<\/cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/span><\/p>\n The founders soon realized that a bike with the power, range and battery life their couriers needed didn\u2019t exist, and so they set out to build one. In 2017, backed by a Kickstarter campaign that saw the company raise $165,000, the startup began manufacturing a bike to fit its needs \u2013 one that promptly <\/span>won the Guinness Book of World Records<\/span><\/a> for the greatest distance traveled on an electric motorbike on a single charge.<\/span><\/p>\n More recently, the Delfast Top 3.0 e-motorbike <\/span>won Forbes\u2019 fastest e-bike of the year<\/span><\/a> in 2022 after the company announced some serious <\/span>upgrades to the vehicle during CES<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n We spoke with Delfast\u2019s co-founders to discuss what it\u2019s like running a startup during a war, how the startup is considering breaking into new business verticals, and the importance of always having a Plan B.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n Note: Serhiy Denysenko\u2019s answers were translated from Ukrainian by a member of Delfast\u2019s team for TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n TC: Serhiy, you’re on the ground in Kyiv. What’s your day-to-day like?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues. It\u2019s important to keep in touch and know that everyone is fine, or as fine as is possible right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Besides my work as a COO, I\u2019ve been helping with volunteering, getting supplies and medicine to people, and this is something that pretty much every Ukrainian is now doing. I had my family relocated to Hungary, so I feel more or less safe, and I\u2019m just trying to work as much as possible and do my best in every possible area, whether that\u2019s supporting the company or supporting Ukraine in general.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n How are you managing your team through this crisis? What\u2019s changed?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>We got used to working remotely during Coronavirus times, so we have our task tracker, where everyone can see his or her task. Every Monday, we have an online Zoom meeting. Previously we only had these meetings at the executive level, but now during the war, we are gathering all together, just to see each other\u2019s faces and ask how they\u2019re doing, how\u2019s everyone feeling. Just to talk with everybody.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n <\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":" “Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues.

But second, and more immediately relevant in this case, you would not know that there is a technique to it that, surprisingly, robots aren’t super good at because they tend to be… crushy. But this robo-berry<\/a> designed by Swiss researchers could usher in a new era of gentle, automated robo-pickers.<\/p>\n The secret to picking a raspberry is to grip it just enough to get purchase and then pull it downwards off the little stem, apparently called the “receptacle,” which seems backwards. Seems simple \u2014 and it is, but only our hands are among the most sensitive and finely controlled constructions in the universe, the culmination of a hundred million years of evolution, outdone only by (I suspect) raccoons.<\/p>\n Robots simply don’t have the senses necessary to figure out the perfect technique for picking a berry. But what if it could communicate with the berry to better sense the forces involved and avoid either a a brutal crushing or humiliating failure-to-detach?<\/p> <\/div>\n That’s what Kai Junge, a PhD student at EPFL in Switzerland, aims to accomplish with this “sensorized raspberry,” a silicone and silicon replica berry that provides feedback to the picking machine, allowing it to learn to pick faster and better \u2014 and cleaner.<\/p>\n “It\u2019s an exciting dilemma for us as robotics engineers,” said professor Josie Hughes, who worked with Junge on the project. “The raspberry harvesting season is so short, and the fruit is so valuable, that wasting them simply isn’t an option. What’s more, the cost and logistical challenges of testing different options out in the field are prohibitive. That\u2019s why we decided to run our tests in the lab and develop a replica raspberry for training harvesting robots.”<\/p>\n Apparently the hard part comes just at the moment of detaching, when the force needed to grip the berry on the receptacle suddenly becomes overkill as the object goes from solid to hollow.<\/p>\n The replica berry has a fluidic sensor that tells the system how much compression is being experienced by the silicone drooplets, allowing the control model to learn how to adjust its grip as if the berry itself is telling it how much is too much.<\/p>\n You can see the berry in action below:<\/p>\n <\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The team plans to present their work at RobotSoft in April. And once the raspberry question is decided, they may move on to other berries, tomatoes, grapes&#8230; even apricots.

Now, the company offers inter-city rides, car ride-sharing, and corporate services in the 10 cities it operates in across Africa and the Middle East.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The partnership between Swvl and Queen\u2019s Gambit came from a mutual interest from both parties<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While searching for a company to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acquire<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl fit the blank-check company\u2019s criteria: strong business fundamentals, mobility and logistics (one of its core verticals), and an ESG ethos around women and affordable transportation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl &#8212; off the back of raising over $170 million in venture capital, expanding to over 16 countries across Latin America, Asia and Africa; hiring executives from Facebook, Uber and Optimus; and acquiring Shotl, Viapool and door2door &#8212; was on a quest for global dominance in the mobility space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A SPAC with Queen\u2019s Gambit was the most suitable option for it from a financial standpoint, and both parties feel strongly about the sustainability angle around transport &#8212; Swvl claims it has prevented approximately 289 million pounds of carbon emissions since its inception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company plans to expand into several countries over the next six months, including Colombia, Mexico, South Africa, and the U.S. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, all eyes will be on the company\u2019s performance as it <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">officially<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starts trading tomorrow in a cooling SPAC market and a generally unsettled public market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s a softness in the market, but as long as the company operates and delivers results, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maybe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today, people don\u2019t pay attention to it, but they will in months ahead,\u201d Grace said about the worrying SPAC and public markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the market will change <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like it always does and people go back to fundamentals at how we look at company\u2019s performances.

But with Minit, the tech giant is doubling down on a software category that could be worth over $11 billion by 2030, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wfmz.com\/news\/pr_newswire\/pr_newswire_technology\/global-process-mining-software-market-size-value-estimated-to-reach-usd-11-096-7-million\/article_a95b3354-ec2f-5389-b761-e4dbbdadbb97.html#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20report%20published,forecast%20period%202022%20to%202030.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according<\/a> to a report from Polaris Market Research.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292372\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear whether the whole of the Minit team will join Microsoft &#8212; or, indeed, whether the company will remain spread across its current locations. (Minit is now headquartered in Amsterdam, with satellite offices in London and New York.) But CEO James Dening said that customers shouldn&#8217;t expect a change in the level of support they&#8217;re currently receiving.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to what it means to become part of an industry leader like Microsoft and what that brings us &#8212; how we can use that scale and excellence to continue to deliver great solutions to our customers,&#8221; Dening wrote in a blog <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minit.io\/blog\/microsoft-minit-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post<\/a> on Minit&#8217;s website. &#8220;It has been a privilege to lead the company for the last year, and I\u2019m excited to continue my journey with the team, as part of what I consider to be the world\u2019s leading software company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Microsoft spokesperson Zara Huang told TechCrunch that the Minit team will move into the\u00a0<span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> Process Insights team and that there will be &#8220;no change&#8221; to the current work location of Minit team members. <span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> is in early stages of determining how Minit will be integrated into its offerings, she said, and the companies will share more details when they&#8217;re available.<\/p>\n<p>Minit, which was founded in 2015 by Rasto Hlavac and had raised \u20ac10.3 million (~$11.40 million) prior to the acquisition, is one of an expanding number of startups developing process mining tools aimed at enterprise clientele. Process mining, also known as task discovery, involves spotting root cause workflow issues and bottlenecks by pulling data from systems including desktop, email apps and workflows. It&#8217;s a key part of robotic process automation (RPA), a technology that promises to automate monotonous, repetitive tasks traditionally performed by human workers while at the same time generating logs to identify potential cost savings.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As Protocol&#8217;s Aisha Counts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/bulletins\/microsoft-process-mining-minit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notes<\/a>, process mining has traditionally been done by system integrators who map out processes by analyzing manual workflows. Process mining software is designed to digitize the approach in a way that reduces the expense, time and effort involved.<\/p>\n<p>Underlining the appetite for process mining technologies, Celonis, a data processing company, earlier this week acquired Minit competitor Process Analytics Factory, which coincidentally integrates with Microsoft&#8217;s Power BI analytics platform. Just in the past several years, RPA vendor Automation Anywhere acquired process discovery and mining startups FortressIQ, Process Gold\\ and StepShot; Blue Prism released a task mining solution called Capture; and rivals including ABBYY and Kryon have expanded their process mining offerings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/\">Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=wqSRCOP7wQ#?secret=2NKiKfcj0k\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;You know the process space is hot when even Microsoft, with its vast resources, has to buy its way in.

SAP acquired German process automation company Signavio in January 2021, just before ServiceNow got into the RPA segment with the buyout of India-based Intellibot.io.

been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robotics-roundup-12\/\">focused on pizza<\/a>. I\u2019ve long posited that this is for two key reasons. First: People like pizza. We eat a lot of it. Americans alone eat three billion pizzas a year. Second: It\u2019s relatively easy to make. The dough provides a fairly straightforward platform onto which ingredients are added.<\/p>\n<p>I say \u201cfairly\u201d here because there are still complications. There\u2019s really no such thing as easy when it comes to building robots that can execute variations on a task at a large scale. Here it\u2019s the dough that presents the problem. Turning a soft and malleable ball of dough into a pizza crust is one of those things humans have figured out how to do efficiently, but it still proves difficult for robot workers.<\/p>\n<p>A team of researchers at MIT, CMU and UC San Diego set out to create what they\u2019ve deemed \u201ccomplex dough-manipulation.\u201d The system is separated into a two-step process, in which the robot must first determine the task and then execute it using a tool like a rolling pin. The system, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2022\/robotic-deformable-object-0331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DiffSkill<\/a>, involves teaching robots complex tasks in simulations.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292473\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>MIT notes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A \u201cteacher\u201d algorithm solves each step the robot must take to complete the task. Then, it trains a \u201cstudent\u201d machine-learning model that learns abstract ideas about when and how to execute each skill it needs during the task, like using a rolling pin. With this knowledge, the system reasons about how to execute the skills to complete the entire task.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The researchers say the system outperformed those trained in the more traditional reinforcement learning model. \u201cOur framework provides a novel way for robots to acquire new skills. These skills can then be chained to solve more complex tasks which are beyond the capability of previous robot systems,\u201d says CSAIL grad student, Yunzhu Li.<\/p>\n<p>This is robotics, so the whole pizza thing is really an initial problem for a system designed to tackle a lot more tasks. The company points to the emerging field of eldercare robotics as a possible use going forward.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A disproportionate number of the early industrial food-making robots we\u2019ve seen have been focused on pizza.

expands its tip jar feature to enable blog-level tipping"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Tumblr is expanding its tip jar feature by introducing blog-level tipping for its iOS and web applications, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/staff.tumblr.com\/post\/680172684795052032\/say-hello-to-blog-level-tipping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> on Wednesday. The company rolled out its tip jar feature <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/09\/tumblr-tips-tip-jar-monetization\/\">last month<\/a> allowing users to leave tips on posts. Today&#8217;s expansion will allow users to leave tips on blogs. Tumblr says the expansion will benefit creators because it permits tipping at the blog level without tying the tip to a specific post.<\/p>\n<p>You can now enable tipping for your blog in your profile or blog view. Once you sign up for tipping, a tip button will become available on your blog view header. To tip a blog on the web, you can select the &#8220;Tip&#8221; button and select how much you&#8217;d like to gift. On the iOS app, you can select the &#8220;Support&#8221; button to send a tip. Tumblr says it&#8217;s working on adding blog-level tipping feature to its Android app soon.<\/p>\n<p>When users tip a creator, they can send a note alongside the tip. Anonymous tips are allowed, but in that case, the tipper isn&#8217;t able to leave a message. Users can send tips of up to $100 each.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291793\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Tumblr doesn&#8217;t take a cut from these payments, but standard credit card fees (2.9% + $0.30) apply. The company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/09\/tumblr-tips-tip-jar-monetization\/\">previously<\/a> told TechCrunch that it will not rely on the Apple and Google internal billing systems to facilitate mobile tips, which means that creators won\u2019t lose an extra 30% to fees.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s tip jar feature follows its launch of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/21\/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators\/\">Post+<\/a> last fall, which allows users to charge a monthly fee for access to exclusive posts. The post <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/22\/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription\/\">wasn\u2019t welcomed<\/a> with open arms on the platform, as\u00a0some Tumblr users\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/22\/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription\/\">told TechCrunch<\/a> that they would have preferred a tip jar feature over a subscription feature. It appears that Tumblr took creator feedback by finally launching Tumblr Tips.<\/p>\n<p>Tumblr is among several other platforms that offer tip jar features to allow users to send one-time payments to creators. Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/06\/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin\/\">rolled out<\/a> a tip jar feature last May that is designed to give users a way to quickly tip creators with a few taps. In addition, TikTok began testing a new in-app tipping feature in October. The feature allows creators to accept money from fans outside of TikTok LIVE streams, where gifting is already supported.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"GWO9mxDZte\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/09\/tumblr-tips-tip-jar-monetization\/\">Tumblr launches a tip jar feature to help bloggers make a buck<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Tumblr launches a tip jar feature to help bloggers make a buck&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/09\/tumblr-tips-tip-jar-monetization\/embed\/#?secret=isjyBxziCX#?secret=GWO9mxDZte\" data-secret=\"GWO9mxDZte\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tumblr is expanding its tip jar feature by introducing blog-level tipping for its iOS and web applications, the company announced on Wednesday.

Apple&#8217;s plans were first announced last September in the context of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/01\/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website\/\">the tech giant&#8217;s settlement with a Japanese regulator,<\/a> the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), and had been set to arrive sometime in early 2022.<\/p>\n<p>The company had earlier said the changes would apply globally to all reader apps on the App Store when they went live, but had not provided an exact launch date.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ggczhDO8Qf\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/01\/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website\/\">Apple announces new settlement with Japan allowing developers to link to external websites \u00a0<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291723\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple announces new settlement with Japan allowing developers to link to external websites \u00a0&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/01\/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website\/embed\/#?secret=EXngPEWI0O#?secret=ggczhDO8Qf\" data-secret=\"ggczhDO8Qf\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Today, Apple&#8217;s App Store Review Guidelines have been <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/app-store\/review\/guidelines\/#reader-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">updated with a new reference<\/a> that explains how Reader apps can implement this feature.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, Apple instructs developers to apply for something it calls the <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/support\/reader-apps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">External Link Account Entitlement<\/a> in order to provide this functionality in their own apps. An entitlement is something Apple uses when it wants to still have control over the situation in terms of which developers can implement a certain feature. That is, instead of just changing the App Store rules so this type of behavior is broadly permitted for apps in the supported category, the entitlement process requires developers to ask and then receive approval for this special use case. This way, Apple can very carefully vet the apps being allowed to add the links instead of leaving it up to its App Review team.<\/p>\n<p>The company also published <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/support\/reader-apps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">usage guidelines and implementation details<\/a> for developers who are approved to use the external link option. Here, Apple explains that not all apps that offer access to digital content will be approved &#8212; the access to digital content has to be the app&#8217;s &#8220;primary functionality,&#8221; Apple states. For instance, a social networking app (<em>ahem, Facebook<\/em>) where users can also stream videos would not be eligible.<\/p>\n<p>Apple also says that, in order to be eligible, the apps must allow the users to access content or services they had previously purchased outside the app; they must allow people to sign in to their account; and they cannot facilitate real-time, person-to-person services &#8212; like live tutoring, fitness instruction, real estate tours or medical consultations.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2291767\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2291767\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2291767\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-3.24.15-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-3.24.15-PM.jpg 1552w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-3.24.15-PM.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-3.24.15-PM.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-3.24.15-PM.jpg?resize=768,507 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-3.24.15-PM.jpg?resize=680,449 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-3.24.15-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-3.24.15-PM.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2291767\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Notably, Apple says apps that choose to use the External Link Account Entitlement cannot offer in-app purchases on either iPhone or iPad devices. It&#8217;s an either\/or situation.<\/p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s instructions detail how the links should work, too, including how they must open up in a new browser window and not a web view, for instance, and how the links should appear. The developer&#8217;s web page also can&#8217;t advertise the pricing offered outside the App Store. It can only say something very simple like: <em>&#8220;go to example.com to create or manage your account.&#8221; <\/em>There are several other more technical requirements, as well.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that these changes have only come about due to governmental regulations and not because Apple believes this is the right thing to do for its App Store. It&#8217;s clear from the heavy-handed way it&#8217;s implementing this support &#8212; and the rules around its use &#8212; that the company views this change as a slippery slope that could ultimately lead to App Store revenue loss.<\/p>\n<p>The changes come at a time when lawmakers and regulators alike have been putting pressure on the app store providers, Apple and Google, in the wake of anti-competitive complaints. The platforms are also battling this out in the courts, as Apple and Google are doing now with Fortnite maker Epic Games, whose antitrust case with Apple is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/08\/apple-wont-have-to-make-the-app-store-changes-ordered-in-epic-ruling-while-case-is-appealed\/\">now under appeal<\/a>. Another class-action <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/22\/apple-updates-its-app-store-guidelines-to-permit-developers-to-contact-customers-about-other-payment-methods\/\">lawsuit pushed Apple to agree<\/a> that developers were allowed to contact their customers about payment methods using the contact information they collected in their apps.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to today&#8217;s change for reader apps, South Korea has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/31\/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission\/\">passed<\/a> legislation that bans Apple and Google from requiring that developers use their respective payment systems. More recently, a bipartisan App Store bill targeting Apple and Google was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, suggesting that U.S. legislation is on the horizon, too. But instead of getting ahead of the changes with an overhaul of how the App Store operates, Apple has been clinging on to every last bit of control it has even as it attempts to adhere to the regulations. This stance has gotten so bad that, in the Netherlands, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/28\/apple-acm-dating-apps-tenth-fine\/\">Apple has been now fined 10 times<\/a> by the local regulatory authority for non-compliance with new rules around third-party payment support for dating apps.<\/p>\n<p>Though Apple has opened up access to request the External Link Account Entitlement today, it notes the API will be available for reader apps to build and test in an &#8220;upcoming beta release of iOS and iPadOS.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple today announced it will begin to allow a subset of applications sold on its App Store to link to an external website where users can create or manage their accounts with the app developer.

source infrastructure-as-a-service project that allows enterprises and public hosting services to run their own on-premise clouds, today released version 25 of its software, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openstack.org\/software\/yoga\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dubbed Yoga<\/a>. Like all large open source projects, OpenStack has gone through its ups and downs, but as the <a href=\"https:\/\/openinfra.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open Infrastructure Foundation<\/a>, the organization behind OpenStack and a number of other projects like Kata Containers, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/06\/openstack-gains-new-momentum-as-deployments-increase-during-the-pandemic\/\">recently announced<\/a>, OpenStack now manages over 25 million CPU cores in production and nine out of the top 10 telcos now run OpenStack, as do large enterprises like Bloomberg, Walmart, Workday and TechCrunch parent Yahoo. China Mobile alone runs an OpenStack deployment with 6 million cores, and more than 180 public cloud data centers now run OpenStack.<\/p>\n<p>Even after 25 releases in 12 years, the OpenStack community is still adding new features, in addition to the usual bug fixes and maintenance updates. As with most recent releases, this means increased support for additional hardware, for example. With Nvidia now a major contributor to OpenStack, there is new support for SmartNIC DPUs, that is, the ability to offload network processing to specialized cards, in OpenStack&#8217;s core networking and compute services. The OpenStack Cinder storage service now also supports LightOS for new storage types like NVMe\/TCP and NEC V Series Storage. Not something you&#8217;d need for a small deployment, but features that will matter to some of OpenStack&#8217;s largest users.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great to see all of those hardware manufacturers getting involved directly in OpenStack to make sure that we correctly support and expose the features in their hardware,&#8221; said the Open Infrastructure Foundation general manager <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/thierry-carrez-652662a\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Thierry Carrez<\/a>. It&#8217;s worth noting that the general manager position is still quite new, with Carrez moving to the job in January of this year after being the VP of Engineering for the OpenStack\/Open Infrastructure Foundation for many years. In this new role, he now oversees the foundation&#8217;s operations, covering engineering, product, community and marketing.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291591\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Other major updates in this release include a new soft delete scheme for OpenStack Manila, the project&#8217;s shared file system service. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/kendall-nelson-a7409575\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kendall Nelson<\/a>, the senior upstream developer advocate for the Open Infrastructure Foundation, likened this to the recycle bin on your desktop. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of those things where it&#8217;s like, you know, why don&#8217;t we do that? We could have been doing this the whole time and I think that Manila has been pretty stable for a while, so [the developers were] like, &#8216;Oh, well, let&#8217;s go and do the obvious things that we could have done all along&#8217;,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>With this release, OpenStack is also expanding its support for a number of cloud-native infrastructure projects like the popular <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cncf.io\/projects\/prometheus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Prometheus<\/a> monitoring system and <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.openstack.org\/wiki\/Kuryr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kuryr<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.openstack.org\/wiki\/Tacker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tacker<\/a> Kubernetes tools, and welcoming two new projects, the <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.openstack.org\/wiki\/Skyline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skyline dashboard<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/wiki.openstack.org\/wiki\/Venus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Venus<\/a> log management module.<\/p>\n<p>As for the Foundation itself, it&#8217;s worth noting that 12 new companies recently joined the organization. These new members are mostly in the lower silver tier, like B1 Systems, Okestro, OpenMetal and TransIP, but Vexxhost, for example, is joining as a gold member. Overall, the organization&#8217;s corporate membership is up 20% since November 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Later this year, the Open Infrastructure Foundation will also host its first in-person conference again, the <a href=\"https:\/\/openinfra.dev\/summit-schedule\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenInfra Summit in Berlin<\/a>, Germany, in early June. &#8220;When we launched the Open Infra Foundation, we said we were going to bring together a community to build the next decade of open infrastructure after 10 years of OpenStack and related projects,&#8221; Open Infrastructure Foundation CEO and Executive Director Jonathan Bryce said. &#8220;We&#8217;re a year into it and it&#8217;s been really exciting to see this coalition of companies who are joining across vendors, new tech leaders like Nvidia, new users like BBC and others, along with the projects that are coming in. I&#8217;m really excited to finally get all of these people back together for the first time since the pandemic.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Soon, the OpenStack project will also change its release cadence. Currently, the community is publishing two releases a year. Starting in 2023, it&#8217;s moving to a &#8220;tick-tock&#8221; schedule, with one major and one minor release on the same six-month cadence as today. In part, this is because of feedback from operators who don&#8217;t want to have to upgrade their environments every six months.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This really helps the smaller OpenStack clouds, because you can reliably like &#8216;okay, well, we have a year to breathe now before the next one,&#8217; as opposed to every six months,&#8221; Bryce said. &#8220;There&#8217;s much less risk than there used to be in terms of upgrading, but it&#8217;s still a lot of work, so for those companies that use OpenStack that are a little bit smaller and have smaller teams or maybe are newer to it, this like long-term support cadence should really help them get off the ground and get moving. And then, the bigger companies that are used to the six-month release cadence like Red Hat are still going to be able to get their features right when they&#8217;re coming out.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OpenStack, the massive open source infrastructure-as-a-service project that allows enterprises and public hosting services to run their own on-premise clouds, today released version 25 of its software, dubbed Yoga.

and deliberate one since we saw an early prototype in Las Vegas <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/16\/mojo-visions-ar-contact-lenses-are-very-cool-but-many-questions-remain\/\">a number of CESes ago<\/a>. You can multiply all of the talk of hardware being hard a few times over when attempting to execute something novel and tiny that\u2019s designed to be worn on one of the more vulnerable parts of the human anatomy.<\/p>\n<p>Today the Bay Area-based firm announced a new prototype of its augmented reality contact lens technology. The system is based around what Mojo calls \u201cInvisible Computing,\u201d its heads up display technology that overlays information onto the lens. Essentially it\u2019s an effort to realize the technology you\u2019ve seen in every science-fiction movie from the past 40+ years. The set-up also features an updated version of the startup\u2019s operating system, all designed to reduce user reliance on screens by &#8212; in a sense &#8212; moving the screen directly in front of their eyes.<\/p>\n<p>The system is building around a 0.5 millimeter microLED display with a remarkably dense 14,000 pixels per inch. The text overlays are highlighted through micro-optics, while data is transferred back and forth via a 5GHz band. All of that is powered by an ARM Core M0 processor. An eye-tracking system is on-board, utilizing acceleromter, gyroscope and magnetometer readings to determine the motion of the wearer\u2019s gaze. That, in turn, forms the foundation of the system\u2019s hands-free control.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291701\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The company writes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Since we first revealed Mojo Lens to the world in January 2020, we\u2019ve been innovating and building, and integrating systems that many people thought couldn\u2019t be built, let alone operational in a contact lens form factor. The most common thing we hear as we share this latest prototype is, \u201cI knew there would be smart contact lenses, but I thought they were 10 or 20 years out, not now.\u201d This is happening and I\u2019m excited about our next milestones and realizing the promise of Invisible Computing.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Of course, things are still in the prototype phase &#8212; so \u201cnow\u201d isn\u2019t now, exactly. The company continues to work with the FDA to help bring the tech to market as part of its Breakthrough Devices Program. The company also announced previous partnerships with fitness brands like Adidas Running to develop workout applications for the tech.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We\u2019ve known Mojo Vision\u2019s journey to market was going to be a long and deliberate one since we saw an early prototype in Las Vegas a number of CESes ago.

indicated the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/10\/26\/22746466\/youtube-podcasting-kai-chuk-amazon-project-mic-live-audio-hot-pod\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hired a podcast executive<\/a>, Kai Chuk, to lead its efforts in the space and had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2022-03-04\/youtube-offers-up-to-300-000-to-get-podcasters-to-make-videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">even begun offering cash<\/a> to popular podcasters to film their shows. Now, a leaked document has unveiled more about YouTube&#8217;s plans in this area, pointing to a future podcasts homepage on YouTube.com and other monetization features.<\/p>\n<p>The details were <a href=\"https:\/\/podnews.net\/update\/youtube-podcasting-plans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published by Podnews<\/a>, which recently got its hands on an 84-page presentation where YouTube described its podcasts roadmap. Here, the company says it will improve podcast ingestion by piloting the ability to pull in podcast RSS feeds. It also noted it plans to centralize podcasts on a new homepage at YouTube.com\/podcasts. The URL doesn&#8217;t yet work; but it also doesn&#8217;t automatically redirect to the YouTube homepage &#8212; which is what it does if you put other random words after the slash.<\/p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Google sees podcasts as a way to expand its advertising business on YouTube. The document suggests YouTube will feature audio ads sold by Google as well as other partners. It mentions the support of &#8220;new metrics&#8221; designed for audio-first creators and the ability to integrate YouTube data into industry-standard podcast measurement platforms. One page shows brands like Nielsen, Chartable and Podtrac listed as partners.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291669\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The addition of a new &#8220;podcasts&#8221; vertical to YouTube would be a logical next step for the company.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, YouTube has highlighted the service&#8217;s larger content categories by giving them their own homepages, as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/08\/25\/youtube-gaming-its-twitch-competitor-set-to-launch-tomorrow\/\">it did with YouTube Gaming<\/a> back in 2015 and with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/09\/05\/youtube-launches-a-dedicated-fashion-vertical\/\">YouTube Fashion (now Fashion &amp; Beauty) in 2019<\/a>. Plus, YouTube content helps to power Google&#8217;s music streaming service, YouTube Music, which competes with other services like Spotify, where podcasts are a competitive advantage.<\/p>\n<p>Spotify has been looking to dominate the podcast advertising market and has made several acquisitions to bring related adtech in-house. As a result, Spotify has since been able to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/10\/spotifys-increased-focus-on-podcasts-in-2019-includes-selling-its-own-ads\/\">sell its own ads<\/a>, introduce <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/08\/spotify-brings-streaming-ad-insertion-technology-to-podcasts\/\">streaming ad insertion technology<\/a>, launch <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/22\/spotify-to-launch-spotify-audience-network-an-audio-ad-marketplace\/\">its own audio ad marketplace<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/06\/spotify-introduces-a-new-ad-format-for-podcasts-that-puts-clickable-cards-inside-shows\/\">is trying out new ad formats<\/a>. Meanwhile, as a video-centric platform, YouTube has been left out of much of this ad market growth.<\/p>\n<p>Podnews didn&#8217;t publish the full document and it&#8217;s not clear when the document was first produced or distributed, given references to launches that are listed as coming &#8220;in 2022&#8221; and the mention of Chartable, a company Spotify <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/16\/spotify-snaps-up-podcast-measurement-and-analytics-firms-podsights-and-chartable\/\">acquired<\/a> last month.

TechCrunch has covered more African startups in the last year than any period in our history. Many of those companies are Nigerian, and when we look at venture capital data, we can see why. The country had an incredible 2021 as the most active venture capital scene in Africa, collecting more than $1.8 billion, or 34% of the $5 billion raised across the continent, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/partechpartners.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Partech<\/a>, a pan-African VC firm that also tracks investments.<\/p>\n<p>The country has posted steady progress in the last three years as the leading African startup market. In 2019, startups based in Nigeria attracted $747 million, or 37% of Africa\u2019s total VC investment. Those numbers decreased to $307 million, or 21% of the continent&#8217;s total, the following year, though 2020 was a venture capital year much impacted by outside forces.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"w250oxm071\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/yc-w22-batch-nets-24-african-startups-including-18-from-nigeria\/\">YC W22 batch nets 24 African startups, including 18 from Nigeria<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;YC W22 batch nets 24 African startups, including 18 from Nigeria&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/yc-w22-batch-nets-24-african-startups-including-18-from-nigeria\/embed\/#?secret=e37pZ4OVdT#?secret=w250oxm071\" data-secret=\"w250oxm071\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Thanks in part to a global boom in venture capital activity last year, Nigeria became the first African country to singlehandedly cross the billion-dollar mark while also collecting bragging rights as the preferred destination for mega-investors like Tiger Global and SoftBank.<\/p>\n<h2>Y Combinator is paying attention<\/h2>\n<p>The ample optimism in Nigeria&#8217;s tech community and belief that better days are ahead are unsurprising, despite questions around investors\u2019 due diligence and the eyebrow-raising valuations of some of the nation&#8217;s startups.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of valuations, no seed-stage company in the country is better priced than <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/yc-w22-batch-nets-24-african-startups-including-18-from-nigeria\/\">those in the Y Combinator club<\/a>. Yesterday, the accelerator graduated its first startup batch featuring its newly revamped terms. The new &#8220;standard deal&#8221; at YC now features more capital, and prices for Y Combinator graduates are reportedly greater than ever. (Keep in mind that only 10% of the current Y Combinator batch had monthly revenue of more than $50,000 when they were accepted into the program.)<\/p>\n<p>Apart from revenue thresholds, the accelerator shared another interesting statistic concerning Nigeria. With 18 startups, it is the first African country to have the third-largest representation when categorized by country. That&#8217;s a milestone for Nigeria, yes, but also an indication of how quickly the African startup scene has developed in a short period of time.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nigerian startups are a huge part of the current Y Combinator cohort.

Ban them from supermarkets, and the problem is solved, right? Right? <em>Right?<\/em> Turns out, as is often the case, there may be a little bit more to that story. Researchers at the University of Georgia suggest that banning the sale of plastic bags may come with a side-dish of unintended consequences.<\/p>\n<p>The new analysis suggests that plastic bag ban policies &#8212; while well-intentioned &#8212; may end up having the opposite effect. The issue that comes up is that grocery bags are viewed as single-use items, but they often get a (brief) second lease on life as liners for small trash cans. Without the shopping bags available, people look for alternatives \u2014 which the researchers suggest means they buy small plastic garbage bags.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe know there is a demand for using plastic bags, and we know, if these policies go into effect, some bags will disappear or will become more costly to get,\u201d said Yu-Kai Huang, a postdoctoral researcher at the UGA Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources. \u201cSo, we wanted to see the effectiveness of this policy in reducing bag usage overall.\u201d<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291586\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Previous studies have looked at the effect of bag bans on plastic consumption, but not the combined effects of fees or a bag ban. An environmental economist, Huang used a new way to calculate the effect of either policy while also accounting for variables such as residents\u2019 income levels and an area\u2019s population density, both of which influence the amount of trash generated in a community.<\/p>\n<p>Keeping in mind the second life that plastic grocery bags take on in many homes, the team measured plastic trash bag sales in counties with bans or fees in place and compared them to other counties without such policies. The study found California communities with bag policies saw sales of four-gallon trash bags increase by 55%, to 75%, and sales of eight-gallon trash bags increase 87%, to 110%. These results echo earlier studies that also showed increases in sales of smaller plastic trash bags. While sales of smaller garbage bags jumped after policies were implemented, sales of larger 13-gallon trash bags \u2014 the size often found in kitchen trash cans in the U.S. \u2014 remained more or less unchanged.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Carryout grocery bags were substituted for similar sizes of trash bags before implementing the regulations,&#8221; the researchers wrote in the research paper. &#8220;After the regulations came into effect, consumers\u2019 plastic bag demand switched from regulated plastic bags to unregulated bags.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If the average plastic bags drawer is anything to go by, most households use far more single-use bags than they have a need for trash bags, so it&#8217;s probably fair to say that taxing or banning single-use plastic bags is a net positive. But I found it interesting to remind us that even the best laid plans can have unintended consequences; a truth that appears to be as true in climate policy as it is elsewhere.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Plastic bags are bad.

But it has become a significant player in the market and counts many of the established quantum computing research institutes and commercial entities as its customers.<\/p>\n<p>Quantum Machines founder and CEO Itamar Sivan told me he first met the QDevil team in person at the last in-person <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aps.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">APS<\/a> March meeting back in 2019 and the companies continued to talk over the course of the next few years. &#8220;At some point, we realized that it would be highly impactful to join forces, because their products are actually complementary to ours. And therefore, we can now provide a more comprehensive orchestration platform,&#8221; said Sivan. It&#8217;s one thing to build a quantum processing unit, after all (or <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/08\/quantware-will-build-you-a-custom-25-qubit-quantum-processor-in-30-days\/\">buy one off the shelf<\/a>), but it takes a lot of expertise to then turn that into a complete quantum computer.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2291529\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/QM-and-Qdevil12.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2291529\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2291529\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/QM-and-Qdevil12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/QM-and-Qdevil12.png 3333w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/QM-and-Qdevil12.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/QM-and-Qdevil12.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/QM-and-Qdevil12.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/QM-and-Qdevil12.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/QM-and-Qdevil12.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/QM-and-Qdevil12.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/QM-and-Qdevil12.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2291529\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Quantum Machines<\/p><\/div><\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291484\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>One of QDevil&#8217;s main products is its <a href=\"https:\/\/qdevil.com\/qdac\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">QDAC<\/a>, a &#8220;high-precision low-noise computer-controlled voltage generator,&#8221; as the company describes it. Qubits obviously hate nothing more than noise, so QDevil&#8217;s low-noise DAC makes it easier for operators to control their qubits. In addition, QDevil also offers a range of other electronics and specialized components for operating quantum processors. Combined with Quantum Machines&#8217; Pulse Processing Units and software, this will allow the two companies to offer a full-stack solution for orchestrating quantum computers. Sivan also stressed that QDevil has done quite a bit of work on controlling quantum dots, which are an increasingly hot topic in the quantum computing world.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;QDevil is one of the premier providers of electronics for quantum computing,&#8221; said Dr.\u00a0<span class=\"xn-person\">Jonatan Kutchinsky<\/span>, CEO of QDevil. &#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to join up with Quantum Machines, a company whose mission and goals align so perfectly with our own. Together we will continue to further develop the quantum community in\u00a0<span class=\"xn-location\">Denmark<\/span>\u00a0and deliver revolutionary technologies that will make it seamless for companies developing quantum computers to realize the potential of their QPUs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sivan also noted that this acquisition brings a lot of new talent to Quantum Machines &#8212; and there is only a finite number of PhD physicists with a specialization in quantum mechanics on the market.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an amazing acquisition for us because it&#8217;s both the technology, the products, the customer base and the people,&#8221; Sivan said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really all of that. They have accomplished amazing achievements and I can firmly say now that [Quantum Machines] plus QDevil is selling to almost all the players in quantum computing globally &#8212; above 90% &#8212; including corporates, startups, national labs.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Chances are, this isn&#8217;t Quantum Machines&#8217; last acquisition. The company has now raised <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/quantum-machines-raises-50m-to-make-quantum-computers-ubiquitous-and-disruptive-across-all-industries-301369668.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$73 million<\/a>, so it has a bit of a war chest to acquire smaller companies and build out its platform. We&#8217;ll likely see the same play out across the market, given how many small, highly specialized companies there are right now, with a number of larger players trying to build full-stack platforms.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I believe that yes, acquisitions are definitely going to be a strategy for Quantum Machines and, I believe, for other companies as well,&#8221; Sivan said. &#8220;Because as the value chain forms, I believe that you will see that eventually, there will be layers in the value chain that will be more or less significant.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Quantum Machines, the well-funded Israeli startup that specializes in building control systems for quantum computers, today announced that it has acquired QDevil, a well-known Danish company that specializes in building control hardware for quantum systems.

gas-guzzling outboards to cleaner, quieter battery powered ones, and the company just raised $15.5 million ahead of a planned summer shipping date.<\/p>\n<p>The conversion of the boating world to electrics is progressing slowly for lots of reasons, but it also seems as inevitable as the electrification of land vehicles. Boats are such big investments, and used so differently from cars, and physically are so much more power-hungry, that it&#8217;s not quite as simple to make the switch.<\/p>\n<p>Flux has designed for, it claims, both convenience and efficiency, with a new take on the traditional rear-mounted outboard.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291053\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve taken a ground-up design approach that places the electric motor above the waterline for scalability, but does not use any legacy combustion outboard parts,&#8221; CEO Ben Sorkin told TechCrunch. &#8220;Our lower unit was developed in-house to accommodate a belt drive, incorporate a closed-loop cooling system with active feedback, and reduce hydrodynamic drag.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When looking at electric motors (electric machines), they are generally rated for a peak torque, determined by geometry and magnetics, and a continuous torque, which is determined by thermal management. Because a boat is subject to high drag forces from water, the key is in designing power electronics and a thermal management system to get the continuous torque as close as possible to peak torque,&#8221; Sorkin continued. &#8220;The end result is a lighter, more efficient total propulsion solution.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2291574\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2291574\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2291574\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/flux-marine-1.jpg\" alt=\"A man drives a dinghy with an electric motor on the back.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/flux-marine-1.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/flux-marine-1.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/flux-marine-1.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/flux-marine-1.jpg?resize=768,500 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/flux-marine-1.jpg?resize=680,442 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/flux-marine-1.jpg?resize=1536,999 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/flux-marine-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2291574\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Flux Marine<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>They also design the battery packs, which is of course a double-edged sword: They&#8217;ll be good&#8230; but expensive, and you can&#8217;t just go out and grab a car battery to add another few miles to the range. (Actual range depends so much on the hull, weight and speed that it&#8217;s impossible to predict, but figure somewhere in the 40-70 mile range.)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The benefits of electric conversion in general are obvious enough that they scarcely need recounting: cleaner, quieter, greener, easier to maintain and potentially better performance.<\/p>\n<p>The downside is primarily cost: Flux aims to make its motors available for $4,000-$12,000, depending on whether you want a 15-horsepower equivalent (one person in a dinghy), 40 HP (a few people in an aluminum rowboat) or 70 HP (a few people in an aluminum rowboat, but going faster); a 100 HP equivalent one is planned as well. The battery pack is sold separately for $3,500 at the 15 HP level, up to $40K for the 70 HP one if you want to go more than a couple miles.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously that limits the number of people who can afford to go green, but boating is kind of an expensive hobby to begin with. If you want to get on the water for two bills, get a paddleboard \u2014 a hull and motor will run you a couple thousand bucks unless you buy the algae-encrusted one from that guy down the dock.<\/p>\n<p>Preorders were opened last year and Sorkin said the company is on track to deliver its first motors this summer, hopefully in time for boating season. Lead times should decrease as they scale up over the next year, he added. In-person demos will be available in Rhode Island (where the company is based and just got a fat tax credit) and Connecticut.<\/p>\n<p>The $15.5 million A round was led by Ocean Zero, with participation from Boost VC, Winklevoss Capital and previous early investors.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The race is certainly on in the electrification of boating \u2026 even if everyone is jockeying for position before the market materializes.

href=\"http:\/\/workspaceupdates.googleblog.com\/2022\/03\/compose-with-markdown-in-google-docs-on.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a blog post<\/a> with Google Workspace customers announcing some good news for all <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Markdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Markdown<\/a> fans out there. Google Docs can now automatically convert Markdown formatting to rich text.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not familiar with Markdown, this markup language has become very popular over the past few years if you want to write structured documents \u2014 and especially web content. For instance, popular note-taking tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.notion.so\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Notion<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/bear.app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bear<\/a> support Markdown. Content management systems like WordPress also let you <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.com\/support\/wordpress-editor\/blocks\/markdown-block\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">enable Markdown<\/a> as a way to write new posts.<\/p>\n<p>This new feature for Google Docs is off by default. You have to manually turn it on in the settings first. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this post. If you want to enable Markdown support, open a document in Google Docs, head over to the top of the screen, go to &#8220;Tools&#8221; then &#8220;Preferences&#8221; and enable &#8220;Automatically detect Markdown.&#8221; After that, you\u2019re good to go. If you can&#8217;t see the feature today, that&#8217;s normal, as the company is rolling out the new feature progressively over the coming days.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291537\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Again, don\u2019t expect extensive Markdown support. Google Docs is still a rich text editor and this isn\u2019t going to magically change once you enable the Markdown feature.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, Google Docs will replace common Markdown formatting with rich text. For instance, you can create links with parentheses and brackets like <code>[this](https:\/\/techcrunch.com)<\/code>. You can italicize text by surrounding it with the <code>*<\/code> character.<\/p>\n<p>Google Docs supports different levels of headings, bold, italic, strikethrough and links. Numbered lists and unstructured lists still get automatically formatted like before.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, this new feature complements some keyboard shortcuts. It also makes it easier to copy Markdown content from one app to Google Docs, which can be particularly useful if you use a Markdown editor like <a href=\"https:\/\/ulysses.app\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ulysses<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But\u2026 that doesn\u2019t work the other way. What\u2019s great about Markdown is that it\u2019s a plain text format that is compatible with multiple apps and services.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Google Docs should let you natively export the current document as Markdown so that you can quickly copy and paste it anywhere Markdown is supported. I know, there is a plugin for that. But not all companies are comfortable with plugins.<\/p>\n<p>Hey Google, it\u2019s a nice first step, but you have to iterate and offer more Markdown features, please.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2291545\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg 1118w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg?resize=146,150 146w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg?resize=291,300 291w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg?resize=768,791 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg?resize=660,680 660w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-30-at-6.51.04-PM.jpeg?resize=32,32 32w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google shared a blog post with Google Workspace customers announcing some good news for all Markdown fans out there.

44 attorneys general stated.<\/p>\n<p>Yesterday, the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) sent a series of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.naag.org\/policy-letter\/naag-urges-tiktok-and-snapchat-to-give-parents-more-control\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">concerns<\/a> to the two social apps, which are commonly used among teens.<\/p>\n<p>The attorneys general cited a range of problems they had with the social media apps, including, more broadly, the negative impact they can have on the physical, emotional and mental well-being of children and teens. They also noted that content depicting abusive sexual relationships can seriously harm a child&#8217;s view of a healthy relationship, helping to perpetuate domestic abuse and human trafficking. And the letter stressed that TikTok and Snapchat don&#8217;t effectively collaborate with third-party parental control apps to allow parents to monitor and restrict what their children can do on their platforms.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291477\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The NAAG cited a study from one such app, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bark.us\/annual-report-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bark<\/a>, which analyzed 3.4 billion messages in 2021 across 30 apps to find that 74.6% of teens were involved in a self-harm\/suicidal situation, 90.73% encountered nudity or sexual content online and 93.31% engaged in conversations about drugs or alcohol.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cParental control apps can alert parents or schools to messages and posts on your platforms that have the potential to be harmful and dangerous. Apps can also alert parents if their child manifests a desire for self-harm or suicide,\u201d the letter reads.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat already has some in-app <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/16\/instagram-rolls-out-new-safety-tools-for-parents\/\">parental controls<\/a>, as does <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/17\/tiktok-expands-parental-controls-to-include-search-commenting-and-account-privacy\/\">TikTok<\/a>, but this group of attorneys general wants the platforms to be more compatible with third-party parental control apps, though they didn\u2019t endorse a particular product. They suggested that parental control apps could access social media app features like private messaging, which the built-in parental controls don&#8217;t monitor. Plus, third-party apps could better filter the user-generated content that appears in the apps&#8217; main feeds.<\/p>\n<p>Still, third-party control apps introduce their own swath of problems regarding which tactics they use to surveil children.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Though TikTok and Snapchat did already have parental controls, its competitor Instagram did not. After a series of Senate hearings about the impact of social media on teen mental health, Meta recently began rolling out <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/16\/instagram-rolls-out-new-safety-tools-for-parents\/\">parental controls<\/a> on Instagram, a long-overdue safety measure.<\/p>\n<p>But teen safety on these platforms remains a concern in the U.S. government, regardless of whether or not parental controls are in place. President Biden even mentioned the threat of social media to teen mental health in his <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/01\/biden-social-media-mental-health-state-of-the-union\/\">State of the Union address<\/a>, which former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen attended as an honored guest.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok is more popular among teens than Instagram, which has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/11\/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok\/\">poured money<\/a> into its TikTok clone Reels to keep up. But as TikTok holds its ground as the fastest-growing social app, Meta has gone to even more dramatic lengths to maintain its prominence. The Washington Post <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/technology\/2022\/03\/30\/facebook-tiktok-targeted-victory\/?request-id=223d214e-1ead-4b0f-80b5-3586e0ed866c&amp;pml=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reported today<\/a> that Meta hired Targeted Victory, a Republican consulting firm, to turn the public against TikTok. In some cases, Targeted Victory attempted to influence public opinion by claiming that certain dangerous viral trends began on TikTok, though they actually <a href=\"https:\/\/www.insider.com\/slap-a-teacher-challenge-tiktok-october-trend-2021-10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">started on Facebook<\/a>. TechCrunch also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/30\/facebook-targeted-victory-definers-gop\/\">reported<\/a> in 2018 that Facebook had worked with Targeted Victory to help slow progress on legislation that would impact the platform\u2019s political ad spending.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTargeted Victory\u2019s corporate practice manages bipartisan teams on behalf of our clients. It is public knowledge we have worked with Meta for several years and we are proud of the work we have done,&#8221; the firm&#8217;s CEO Zac Moffatt said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>In any case, there&#8217;s only so much that parental controls can do to keep apps safe for teens &#8212; it&#8217;s on the apps themselves too to make sure that they aren&#8217;t serving teens unsafe content.<\/p>\n<p><em>Update, 3\/30\/22 at 4:38 PM EST with statement from Targeted Victory.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"3nLetIxmE5\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/30\/facebook-targeted-victory-definers-gop\/\">Facebook quietly hired Republican strategy firm Targeted Victory<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook quietly hired Republican strategy firm Targeted Victory&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/30\/facebook-targeted-victory-definers-gop\/embed\/#?secret=MtwdorjDEB#?secret=3nLetIxmE5\" data-secret=\"3nLetIxmE5\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"AOVwHEQr7K\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/01\/biden-social-media-mental-health-state-of-the-union\/\">Biden will address social media&#8217;s mental health impact at State of the Union<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Biden will address social media&#8217;s mental health impact at State of the Union&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/01\/biden-social-media-mental-health-state-of-the-union\/embed\/#?secret=yT8olHrs8u#?secret=AOVwHEQr7K\" data-secret=\"AOVwHEQr7K\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TikTok and Snapchat need more parental controls, a letter signed by 44 attorneys general stated.

policy proposals that will expand existing ecodesign rules on energy efficiency by encouraging longer product lifespans, supporting the growth of circular economy business models and helping consumers combat greenwashing and make more environmentally friendly purchasing choices, as regional lawmakers work to make good on a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/ip_20_420\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Circular Economy Action Plan<\/a> announced two years ago.<\/p>\n<p>The bloc&#8217;s overarching <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/strategy\/priorities-2019-2024\/european-green-deal_en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">European Green Deal<\/a> plan has the stated goal of making the region &#8220;climate neutral&#8221; by 2050.<\/p>\n<p>That mission translates to no net emissions of greenhouse gases within a time frame of (now) just under three decades while decoupling the EU&#8217;s economic growth from resource use &#8212; aka a shift to a circular economy where products are designed to last longer and also to be easy to disassemble for reuse or recycling at end of life. So there is, very clearly, lots of work for policymakers to do.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291279\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine has only added to the urgency of the EU&#8217;s climate mission &#8212; underscoring the case for the bloc to rapidly move away from using fossil fuels for energy and wider economic fuel as many Member States remain heavily reliant on oil and gas from Russia, leaving their economies exposed to the ongoing regional instability.<\/p>\n<p>In a press release announcing its latest sustainability policy package, the Commission suggests that, by 2030, the revised ecodesign framework could lead to 132 mtoe [million tonnes of oil equivalent] of primary energy savings &#8212; which it emphasizes is &#8220;almost equivalent to EU&#8217;s import of Russian gas&#8221; (which corresponds to &#8220;roughly to 150 bcm [billion cubic meters] of natural gas&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>It is also keen to flag the value of existing EU ecodesign requirements (which are focused on energy efficiency) &#8212; saying they saved consumers \u20ac120 billion and led to a 10% lower annual energy consumption by the products in scope.<\/p>\n<p>The latest proposals to slot under the EU&#8217;s &#8220;green deal&#8221; umbrella include an interesting idea for Digital Product Passports (see below) &#8212; which is part of a wider push to increase product sustainability via a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/environment\/communication-making-sustainable-products-norm_en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Regulation on Ecodesign for Sustainable Products<\/a> (aka ESPR)<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">. <\/span>The latter sets new requirements to &#8220;make products more durable, reliable, reusable, upgradable, reparable, easier to maintain, refurbish and recycle<em>,\u00a0<\/em>and energy and resource efficient&#8221;; and looks set to apply across the board from products such as metals and textiles all the way up to mobile phones and tablets.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The objective of the Commission&#8217;s Ecodesign proposal is to make sustainable products the norm on the EU market and reduce their overall environmental and climate impacts,&#8221; the EU&#8217;s executive writes, adding: &#8220;The \u2018take-make-use-dispose&#8217; model can be avoided, and much of a product&#8217;s environmental impacts is determined at the design stage.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The ecodesign proposal extends existing EU rules in this area to both broaden the scope of products covered by ecodesign regulations (the Commission says it wants almost all products to fall in scope in the future) and to broaden requirements on those products to encompass circularity and an overall reduction of products&#8217; environmental and climate footprint, in addition to energy efficiency criteria.<\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s fair to say that the bloc&#8217;s concept of &#8216;ecodesign&#8217; is being radically redesigned &#8212; and, well, upgraded.<\/p>\n<p>The Commission argues that this broader ecodesign strategy will lead to more energy and resource independence and less pollution, and also anticipates it creating &#8220;economic opportunities for innovation and job creation&#8221;, especially in areas such as remanufacturing, maintenance, recycling and repair. So hot European startups of the future could be in areas like smarter waste management and upcycling.<\/p>\n<p>Specific per product requirements aren&#8217;t clear, as yet, as the EU&#8217;s approach starts with a big picture proposal for a framework and a process &#8212; via which the Commission (&#8220;working in close cooperation with all those concerned&#8221;) will gradually set out requirements for each product or group of products, yielding specific stipulations down the line.<\/p>\n<p>Its approach also suggests there could end up being a degree of variability in requirements across different types of products, as various trade offs (perhaps product longevity vs energy efficiency of manufacture, say) are weighed up and variously assessed in each specific product context. (Variation may also creep in as a result of sector-specific lobbying ofc.)<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 5\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&#8220;These ecodesign requirements will be tailored to the particular characteristics of the product groups concerned,&#8221; the Commission writes in a communication on the proposal. &#8220;Their identification and development will factor-in the potential for improvement and relative effectiveness in delivering increased resource and energy efficiency, enabling longer product life and maximising the value embedded in materials, reducing pollution and the overall impact of products on climate and the <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">environment.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In a list of sample ecodesign requirements which may apply to different types of products, the communication offers examples that include mandates to minimize waste (such as packaging waste); set a minimum level of recycled content that a product must contain; and require <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">ease of disassembly, remanufacturing and recycling of products and materials, among others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Only a few sectors, such as food, feed, and medicinal products, are exempted,&#8221; the EU further specifies in a <a href=\"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/commission\/presscorner\/detail\/en\/qanda_22_2014\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Q&amp;A<\/a> on the sustainable products initiative which also states that incoming ecodesign and labelling rules will cover product groups which are not regulated now, such as smartphones, tablets and photovoltaic solar systems.<\/p>\n<p>So gadgets look set to fall squarely in scope, along with almost every other type of non-edible thing and\/or material used to make things which may be picked up off a shelf by or dropshipped to an EU consumer in the future (not to mention the packaging itself).<\/p>\n<p>Commenting in a statement, VirginijusSinkevi\u010dius, the EU commissioner for the environment, oceans and fisheries, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Our circular economy proposals kick off an era where products will be designed in a way that brings benefits to all, respects the boundaries of our planet and protects the environment. Giving a longer lifespan to the phones we use, to the clothes we wear and to many other products will save money for European consumers. And at the end of their life products will not be a source of pollution but of new materials for the economy, decreasing the dependency of European businesses on imports.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Commission will launch a public consultation on the categories of products to be selected under the first ESPR working plan by the end of this year &#8212; but it suggests the first focus will be on product categories such as textiles, furniture, mattresses, tyres, detergents, paints, lubricants, and on intermediate products like iron, steel and aluminium, as it says these have &#8220;high environmental impact and potential for improvement&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>As the bloc expands ecodesign rules, repairability in general looks set to get a massive boost &#8212; again also for electronics, an area where the Commission already said (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/11\/european-lawmakers-propose-a-right-to-repair-for-mobiles-and-laptops\/\">March 2020<\/a>) it would be expanding requirements.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Work has advanced significantly with assessing the feasibility of ecodesign requirements and an energy labelling scheme for mobile phones and tablets,&#8221; it notes in a communication on its Ecodesign and Energy Labelling Working Plan, adopted today as a transitory measure &#8220;to cover new energy-related products, update and increase the ambition for products that are already regulated&#8221; until the expanded ecodesign regulation enters into force. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;The requirements would be affecting energy efficiency as well as material efficiency (durability, reparability, upgradability and recycling) aspects.

This will make it easier to repair or recycle products and facilitate tracking substances of concern along the supply chain. Labelling can be introduced as well.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Digital product passports <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">will be &#8220;the norm&#8221; for all products regulated under the ESPR, per the Commission &#8212; with the goal to ensure that products are &#8220;tagged, identified and linked to data relevant to their circularity and sustainability&#8221;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This proposal will&#8230; enable information requirements to be set for products to know more about the impacts of the products on our shelves and make more sustainable choices along the whole value chain,&#8221; it adds.<\/p>\n<p>How exactly this will work isn&#8217;t clear but presumably something like a QR code could be fixed to each product for scanning to view the associated sustainability data.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Digital Product Passports will be rolled out for all regulated products,&#8221; the Commission writes. &#8220;The product information can also take the form of \u2018classes of performance&#8217; &#8212; for instance ranging from \u2018A to G&#8217; &#8212; to facilitate comparison between products, possibly displayed in the form of a label. This would work in a manner similar to how the widely recognized EU Energy Label currently works, and be for instance used for a repairability score.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The EU is also eyeing the potential for this standardized &#8216;metadata&#8217; system to create other data-sharing opportunities &#8212; which could even lead to other types of business opportunity, or support additional pieces of sustainability legislation across the bloc.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;Pioneering this approach for environmental sustainability data can also pave the way for wider voluntary data sharing, going beyond the products and requirements regulated under the ESPR,&#8221; the Commission suggests.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> &#8220;Moreover, product passports may be used for information on other sustainability aspects applicable to the relevant product group pursuant to other Union legislation.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>&#8220;Structuring information on the environmental sustainability of products and transmitting it by means of digital product passports will help businesses along the value chain, from manufacturers, importers and distributors to dealers, repairers, remanufacturers and recyclers, to access information that is valuable in their work to improve environmental performance, prolong product lifetime, boost efficiency and the use of secondary raw materials, thus lowering the need for primary natural resources, saving costs and reducing strategic dependencies,&#8221; it also argues.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This will also help track the presence of substances of concern throughout the life cycle of materials and products, following through on commitments made in the Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability and contributing to the EU\u2019s aim to achieve zero pollution. Digital product passports can also enable consumers to make more informed choices, improve transparency for public interest organisations and help national authorities in their enforcement and surveillance work.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Other measures in the EU&#8217;s ecodesign expansion proposal seek to end the destruction of unsold consumer goods &#8212; a practice that can be disturbingly widespread in ecommerce (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/6\/21\/22543527\/amazon-unsold-products-destruction-investigation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hi Amazon!<\/a>) and fashion, for example &#8212; through &#8220;far-reaching transparency requirements for those choosing to discard unsold goods, and the possibility to ban their destruction for relevant product groups&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[L]arge businesses that discard unsold products will have to disclose their number per year, the reasons for the discarding and information on the amount of discarded products that they have delivered for preparing for re-use, remanufacturing, recycling, energy recovery and disposal operations in line with the waste hierarchy. They will have to ensure this information is made available, either on a freely accessible website, or via other means,&#8221; the Commission writes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This measure will apply to all concerned economic operators as soon as the regulation enters into force. The proposal explicitly prohibits circumvention techniques, such as a big company selling to small companies (which are normally exempted) to make them destroy products.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Green public procurement will also be supported through mandatory criteria in the regulation.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, the Commission has presented two targeted sectoral initiatives today &#8212; one focused on sustainability and circularity of textiles, with the strategy there intended<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> to <\/span>make<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing:

to build out private and collaborative workspaces for its burgeoning customer base.<\/p>\n<p>We <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/skiff-encrypted-collaboration-seed\/\">wrote about Skiff last year<\/a> ahead of its launch: Skiff is a web app that has much of the same document-writing and sharing capabilities as Google Docs but is built on a foundation of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/end-to-end-encryption\/\">end-to-end encryption<\/a>, so Skiff does not have access to users&#8217; documents like Google does. The startup already has more than 20,000 people using its platform, leaps ahead of the 8,000 waitlisted users it had when we first spoke to the company last May.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s the end-to-end encryption platform that Skiff relies on that holds the keys to the company&#8217;s future. Now with $10.5 million in Series A funding in the bank, Skiff&#8217;s co-founders Andrew Milich and Jason Ginsberg tell TechCrunch that the company is working toward becoming the &#8220;application layer for the decentralized web.&#8221;<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291395\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>A core part of the company&#8217;s efforts have been on decentralization, a process that allows its users to take ownership of their data. Over the past year Skiff has partnered with Protocol Labs to offer decentralized storage, known as IPFS, or the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/19\/brave-web-browser-adds-native-support-for-peer-to-peer-ipfs-protocol\/\">Interplanetary File System<\/a>, which allows Skiff to encrypt their documents and scatter them across a network of storage hosts, as well as integrating MetaMask, letting users sign in to Skiff using a portable crypto wallet instead of an email address.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The way we look at it is Web 2.0 is really about moving information around and web3 is about moving value around,&#8221; said Ginsberg, Skiff&#8217;s CTO, in a call. &#8220;Data is the most valuable thing on the internet, and our goal is that you really should own your own data.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ginsberg said the company is focused on growing its product offering, such as communication, and allowing users to share more kinds of data on its platform.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We see hundreds of millions of people choosing privacy products not really meeting the needs of working together remotely, and so that&#8217;s really where we see Skiff coming in. There&#8217;s tons of different products that we could do along those lines. We&#8217;re most interested right now in exploring products that not just deal with the document side of things, but also the communication side,&#8221; said Ginsberg.<\/p>\n<p>Milich, the startup&#8217;s chief executive, said the round \u2014 led by Sequoia as a returning investor \u2014 will help the company build out those new products that also rely on end-to-end encryption, like communication. Skiff currently has a team of 15 employees dotted across the globe, Milich said. The Series A brings Skiff&#8217;s total funding to about $14 million.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSkiff is building an amazing team and visionary products to lead this moment,&#8221; said Konstantine Buhler, a partner at Sequoia. &#8220;We couldn\u2019t be more excited to double down.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ovSVa2qy9F\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/skiff-encrypted-collaboration-seed\/\">Skiff, an end-to-end encrypted alternative to Google Docs, raises $3.7M seed<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Skiff, an end-to-end encrypted alternative to Google Docs, raises $3.7M seed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/skiff-encrypted-collaboration-seed\/embed\/#?secret=NwsyJlSLJN#?secret=ovSVa2qy9F\" data-secret=\"ovSVa2qy9F\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Six months after launching its end-to-end encrypted document editor, Skiff has bagged another $10.5 million in fresh funding to build out private and collaborative workspaces for its burgeoning customer base.

You only find out three days later when the neighbors are furiously and passive-aggressively putting up signs around the apartment building about &#8220;someone&#8221; throwing loud parties on the third floor. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minut.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minut<\/a> just raised $14 million to further expand its privacy-forward &#8220;shhhh, it&#8217;s time to take it down a few notches&#8221; solutions for the hospitality sector.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I was talking with one of the first employees at Airbnb, when they were at Y Combinator. Even in the very early days, they had an issue: When people are renting out their apartments they have a monitoring need. There was no other option but to put up cameras, and that was turning into a big problem for Airbnb,&#8221; Nils Mattisson, co-founder and CEO of Minut, explains where the idea came from. &#8220;Years later, that idea came back to me. Having been at Apple and having worked with a lot of technologies that were ahead of the times, in terms of combining machine learning and privacy. I first saw how these two came together and how we would be able to solve this problem and balance monitoring and privacy in a good way. So that was the original seed and where we&#8217;ve come back to now, almost 10 years later.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Minut sensor monitors noise, occupancy, motion and temperature in vacation rental properties. The company sees itself in the role of a co-host, supporting hosts in preventing parties, enhancing the guest experience and protecting their homes.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2290053\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The sensor is about the size of the palm of your hand. It&#8217;s an IoT device &#8212; it&#8217;s got a small computer in there and a bunch of different sensors. Instead of streaming the data to the cloud, we built a solution where analysis is happening on the sensor. And that enables you to use it in cases where you need to respect the privacy of people. That has enabled us to target the short-term rental sector. If you&#8217;re renting out your flat, you want to make sure that you get it back in the same way,&#8221; says Mattisson. &#8220;The value we provide to the host and to the guest is really that we provide monitoring. When we see there are problems with over-occupancy or things that could disturb neighbors, we contact the guests. In over 90% of cases, that means the problem goes away.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Occupancy and room-use monitoring is big business across several sectors, and t<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">here are a number of products on the market that function similarly to Minut. <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/density.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Density<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">, <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/innerspace.io\/beyond-occupancy-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">InnerSpace<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> and <\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/vergesense.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VergeSense<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> (the latter of whom recently raised $60 million) are competing for occupancy sensing for office and industrial buildings; in the residential sector, there are a few options, too. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;We want to help you protect your space, maintain the privacy of your guests, and preserve your relationship with neighbors.

The selling point is to be able to offer near-real-time data, without compromising guest privacy.

To an investor we look more like a software company,&#8221; says Mattisson. &#8220;On top of the sensor, we are able to build this SaaS platform &#8212; we wouldn&#8217;t be able to do that if we didn&#8217;t have the data underneath.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Minut&#8217;s Series B was led by Almaz Capital, with participation from Zenith, Kompas, Verve Ventures and Swiss Immo Lab.

<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/11\/01\/business\/banks-crypto-bitcoin.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">institutional investors<\/a>, digitally-savvy employers realize tokens are an increasingly attractive form of compensation, especially for their millennial staff.<\/p>\n<p>But paying employees in digital assets can create all sorts of administrative hurdles. Human resources managers manually record who has been paid what on a giant Excel sheet but can easily lose track of where the tokens are going, as transactions are largely decentralized. And because token holders are also supposed to be shareholders in an organization, changes of ownership can tip the control and power within the company.<\/p>\n<p>Started three years ago, Sprout is trying to make the ownership of digital assets more traceable and transparent for organizations. The Hong Kong-based startup was founded by Andy Lee and Tony Sun, who used to work together at Mapbox, as a cap table software provider. It was helping mid-size startups keep track of equity as they grew, but last summer, as the price of Bitcoin shot to a historic high, the company began getting requests from its clients to help manage employee tokens.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2290478\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Sprout created Folium in light of this customer demand to help companies trace digital coins and non-fungible tokens across various blockchain platforms. Folium begins by collecting individuals&#8217; blockchain addresses, reading ledger changes and labeling them according to ownership, like whether it belongs to an employee, investor or founder, and the type of transactions; that is, whether it&#8217;s a payroll or investment.<\/p>\n<p>Once all the wallets are tagged, Sprout will have a token cap table ready just as it has done for equity ownership. Tracking tokens gives more transparency to founders, investors and ultimately regulators, reckoned Lee.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We think there&#8217;s a tremendous opportunity to help traditional and crypto companies manage tokens,&#8221; said Lee, who previously worked on Uber&#8217;s business development across Asia, including China. &#8220;Crypto is next-generation compensation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Sprout has hit a sweet spot managing both traditional equity and the flourishing space of digital tokens via its SaaS platform. With this two-thronged strategy in place, the startup managed to raise $3 million from a seed funding round that recently closed.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Investors from the round included Sequoia Capital India, U.S.-based venture funds Sovereign\u2019s Capital and Firsthand Ventures, as well as Hong Kong&#8217;s NDN2 and the special administrative region&#8217;s government-backed funds. Prominent angel investor Ruby Lu, who is known for her early bet on Kuaishou, TikTok&#8217;s nemesis in China, also participated.<\/p>\n<p>Sprout is first going after companies in Hong Kong and Singapore, which have emerged as major nexus for crypto companies. &#8220;There are, anecdotally, a lot of employees and people in the Asia Pacific who understand tokens more than equity,&#8221; Lee observed. &#8220;So it&#8217;s actually attractive for a company [in the region] to think about, especially if they&#8217;re moving into web3, having tokens.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>With its new proceeds, Sprout plans to add more product and engineering staff to its current team of 30 and expand in Singapore. The company declined to mention how many customers it&#8217;s servicing but said Hong Kong-based microinsurance firm YAS Digital and crypto gaming company Animoca Brands are among its early users.<\/p>\n<p><em>The article was updated to clarify that Sequoia didn&#8217;t lead the round.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"aP9cOhfJlS\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/09\/tokens-can-better-incentivize-startup-employees-than-equity\/\">Tokens can better incentivize startup employees than equity<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Tokens can better incentivize startup employees than equity&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/09\/tokens-can-better-incentivize-startup-employees-than-equity\/embed\/#?secret=VBbQbiHXJz#?secret=aP9cOhfJlS\" data-secret=\"aP9cOhfJlS\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As cryptocurrency goes mainstream, attracting individual and institutional investors, digitally-savvy employers realize tokens are an increasingly attractive form of compensation, especially for their millennial staff.

it&#8217;s bringing quite a few interesting changes to the platform. The most obvious one is a new launcher, which is moving from the bottom to the side of the screen and getting a few more new features. The built-in camera app now also lets you save your creations as a GIF and the Chrome OS dictation feature now makes it easier to edit your text. Also new is support for more than 100 additional devices for the newly launched <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/15\/google-wants-to-bring-chrome-os-to-your-pc-or-mac\/\">Chrome OS Flex<\/a>. For developers, Google is launching a redesigned <a href=\"http:\/\/chromeos.dev\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ChromeOS.dev<\/a> site.<\/p>\n<p>The launcher is likely the first thing users will notice. Mind you, the taskbar itself isn&#8217;t moving, we&#8217;re just talking about Chrome OS&#8217;s equivalent of the Windows Start menu. Google says the idea here is to leave more space for other windows you have open. Users can now organize their apps by name or color (if that&#8217;s your thing) or manually arrange them in any order that makes sense to you (or you can be like me and just opt for chaos).<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2291392\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Launcher.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2291392\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2291392\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Launcher.gif\" alt=\"Google Chrome OS new launcher\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2291392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291388\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Inside the launcher, Google has updated the search feature, which previously showed a brief preview of the search result. After this update, you&#8217;ll get to see quite a bit more information, even before you head into the browser. Shortcuts are also now integrated into this search experience, so you can easily take a screenshot, for example.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2291462\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Text-Dictation-Editing.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2291462\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2291462\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Text-Dictation-Editing.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"782\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Text-Dictation-Editing.png 1228w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Text-Dictation-Editing.png?resize=150,115 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Text-Dictation-Editing.png?resize=300,229 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Text-Dictation-Editing.png?resize=768,587 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Text-Dictation-Editing.png?resize=680,519 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Text-Dictation-Editing.png?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2291462\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As for voice editing, the experience here is what you would expect.

Pretty straightforward, to the point where one has to wonder why these features weren&#8217;t there before, but definitely a very useful addition for users who rely on dictation.<\/p>\n<p>The GIF creation in the Chromebook Camera explains itself.

rolls out AI improvements to aid with Search safety and &#8216;personal crisis&#8217; queries"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Google today announced it will be rolling out improvements to its AI model to make Google Search a safer experience and one that&#8217;s better at handling sensitive queries, including those around topics like suicide, sexual assault, substance abuse and domestic violence. It&#8217;s also using other AI technologies to improve its ability to remove unwanted explicit or suggestive content from Search results when people aren&#8217;t specifically seeking it out.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, when people search for sensitive information &#8212; like suicide, abuse or other topics &#8212; Google will display the contact information for the relevant national hotlines above its search results. But the company explains that people who are in crisis situations may search in all kinds of ways, and it&#8217;s not always obvious to a search engine that they&#8217;re in need, even if it would raise flags if a human saw their search queries. With machine learning and the latest improvements to Google&#8217;s AI model called MUM (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.blog.google\/products\/search\/introducing-MUM\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Multitask Unified Model<\/a>), Google says it will be able to automatically and more accurately detect a wider range of personal crisis searches because of how MUM is able to better understand the intent behind people&#8217;s questions and queries.<\/p>\n<p>The company last year introduced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/google-is-redesigning-search-using-a-i-technologies-and-new-features\/\">its plan to redesign Search using AI technologies<\/a> at its Search On event, but it hadn&#8217;t addressed this specific use case. Instead, Google then had focused on how MUM&#8217;s better understanding of user intent could be leveraged to help web searchers unlock deeper insights into the topic they&#8217;re researching, and lead users down new search paths. For example, if a user had searched for &#8220;acrylic painting,&#8221; Google could suggest &#8220;things to know&#8221; about acrylic painting, like different techniques and styles, tips on how to paint, cleaning tips and more. It also could point users to other queries they may not have thought to search for, like &#8220;how to make acrylic paintings with household items.&#8221; In this one example, Google said it could identify more than 350 different topics related to acrylic paintings.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291370\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>In a somewhat similar way, MUM will now be used to help better understand the sort of topics that someone in crisis might search for, which aren&#8217;t always as obvious as typing in a direct cry for help.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;if we can\u2019t accurately recognize that, we can\u2019t code our systems to show the most helpful search results. That&#8217;s why using machine learning to understand language is so important,&#8221; explained Google in a blog post.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if a user searched for &#8220;Sydney suicide hot spots,&#8221; Google&#8217;s previous systems would understand the query to be one of information-seeking because that&#8217;s how the term &#8220;hots spots&#8221; is often used, including in travel search queries. But MUM understands the query is related to people trying to find a jumping spot for suicide in Sydney and would identify this search as potentialy being from someone in crisis, allowing it to show actionable information like suicide hotlines. Another suicide query that could see improvements from MUM is &#8220;most common ways suicide is completed,&#8221; which, again, Google would have previously understood only as an information-seeking search.<\/p>\n<p>MUM also better understands longer search queries where the context is obvious to humans, but not necessarily to machines. For instance, a query like &#8220;why did he attack me when i said i dont love him&#8221; implies a domestic violence situation. But long, natural-language queries have been difficult for Google&#8217;s systems without the use of advanced AI.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In addition, Google notes that MUM can transfer its knowledge across the 75 languages it&#8217;s been trained on, which helps it to more quickly scale AI improvements like this to worldwide users. That means it will be able to display the actionable information from trusted partners, like local hotlines, for these types of personal crisis searches to a broader audience.<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time MUM had been put to work to help direct Google Searches. MUM had previously been used to improve searches for <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/search\/how-mum-improved-google-searches-vaccine-information\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">COVID-19 vaccine information<\/a>, the company said. In the coming months, Google says it will use MUM to improve its spam protection features and will expand those to languages where it has little training data. Other MUM improvements will roll out soon, as well.<\/p>\n<p>Another area getting a boost from AI technology is Google&#8217;s ability to filter explicit content from search results. Even when Google&#8217;s SafeSearch filtering technology is turned off, Google still attempts to reduce unwanted explicit content from those searches where finding racy content wasn&#8217;t the goal. And today, its algorithms improve on this ability as users conduct hundreds of millions of searches globally.<\/p>\n<p>But the AI technology known as <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/search\/search-language-understanding-bert\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BERT<\/a> now works to help Google better understand if people were seeking explicit content. The company says, over the past year, BERT has reduced unwanted shocking search results by 30%, based on an analysis conducted by &#8220;Search Raters&#8221; who measured oversexualized results across random samples of queries for web and image search. The technology has also been particularly effective in reducing explicit content for searches related to &#8220;ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender,&#8221; which Google says disproportionately impacts women and especially women of color, the analysis found.<\/p>\n<p>Google says the MUM AI improvements will begin to roll out to Serach in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google today announced it will be rolling out improvements to its AI model to make Google Search a safer experience and one that&#8217;s better at handling sensitive queries, including those around topics like suicide, sexual assault, substance abuse and domestic violence.
