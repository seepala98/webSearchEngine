Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in late February, Delfast\u2019s top priority has been to see its Ukrainian team of 30 safely evacuated from the most dangerous parts of the country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n When not focusing on sales, marketing, R&D and customer support, Delfast\u2019s smaller team of seven employees based in Los Angeles has been pleading with U.S. politicians and the European Commission to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and fighter jets that could help Ukraine gain back some control over its air space, and, hopefully, put a stop to this war.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Delfast\u2019s co-founders, Daniel Tonkopi and Serhiy Denysenko, say they have always believed in safeguarding the future. When they founded Delfast in 2014, originally as a delivery company, Tonkoply and Denysenko knew that providing couriers with green transportation options would be critical to the company\u2019s operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n \t \n\t\t \n\t\t\tThe most important thing for an entrepreneur, and in general for any leader, is to protect the team and be completely honest with them during a tough time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Tonkopi, co-founder of Delfast<\/cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/span><\/p>\n The founders soon realized that a bike with the power, range and battery life their couriers needed didn\u2019t exist, and so they set out to build one. In 2017, backed by a Kickstarter campaign that saw the company raise $165,000, the startup began manufacturing a bike to fit its needs \u2013 one that promptly <\/span>won the Guinness Book of World Records<\/span><\/a> for the greatest distance traveled on an electric motorbike on a single charge.<\/span><\/p>\n More recently, the Delfast Top 3.0 e-motorbike <\/span>won Forbes\u2019 fastest e-bike of the year<\/span><\/a> in 2022 after the company announced some serious <\/span>upgrades to the vehicle during CES<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n We spoke with Delfast\u2019s co-founders to discuss what it\u2019s like running a startup during a war, how the startup is considering breaking into new business verticals, and the importance of always having a Plan B.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n Note: Serhiy Denysenko\u2019s answers were translated from Ukrainian by a member of Delfast\u2019s team for TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n TC: Serhiy, you’re on the ground in Kyiv. What’s your day-to-day like?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues. It\u2019s important to keep in touch and know that everyone is fine, or as fine as is possible right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Besides my work as a COO, I\u2019ve been helping with volunteering, getting supplies and medicine to people, and this is something that pretty much every Ukrainian is now doing. I had my family relocated to Hungary, so I feel more or less safe, and I\u2019m just trying to work as much as possible and do my best in every possible area, whether that\u2019s supporting the company or supporting Ukraine in general.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n How are you managing your team through this crisis? What\u2019s changed?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>We got used to working remotely during Coronavirus times, so we have our task tracker, where everyone can see his or her task. Every Monday, we have an online Zoom meeting. Previously we only had these meetings at the executive level, but now during the war, we are gathering all together, just to see each other\u2019s faces and ask how they\u2019re doing, how\u2019s everyone feeling. Just to talk with everybody.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n <\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":" “Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues.

But second, and more immediately relevant in this case, you would not know that there is a technique to it that, surprisingly, robots aren’t super good at because they tend to be… crushy. But this robo-berry<\/a> designed by Swiss researchers could usher in a new era of gentle, automated robo-pickers.<\/p>\n The secret to picking a raspberry is to grip it just enough to get purchase and then pull it downwards off the little stem, apparently called the “receptacle,” which seems backwards. Seems simple \u2014 and it is, but only our hands are among the most sensitive and finely controlled constructions in the universe, the culmination of a hundred million years of evolution, outdone only by (I suspect) raccoons.<\/p>\n Robots simply don’t have the senses necessary to figure out the perfect technique for picking a berry. But what if it could communicate with the berry to better sense the forces involved and avoid either a a brutal crushing or humiliating failure-to-detach?<\/p> <\/div>\n That’s what Kai Junge, a PhD student at EPFL in Switzerland, aims to accomplish with this “sensorized raspberry,” a silicone and silicon replica berry that provides feedback to the picking machine, allowing it to learn to pick faster and better \u2014 and cleaner.<\/p>\n “It\u2019s an exciting dilemma for us as robotics engineers,” said professor Josie Hughes, who worked with Junge on the project. “The raspberry harvesting season is so short, and the fruit is so valuable, that wasting them simply isn’t an option. What’s more, the cost and logistical challenges of testing different options out in the field are prohibitive. That\u2019s why we decided to run our tests in the lab and develop a replica raspberry for training harvesting robots.”<\/p>\n Apparently the hard part comes just at the moment of detaching, when the force needed to grip the berry on the receptacle suddenly becomes overkill as the object goes from solid to hollow.<\/p>\n The replica berry has a fluidic sensor that tells the system how much compression is being experienced by the silicone drooplets, allowing the control model to learn how to adjust its grip as if the berry itself is telling it how much is too much.<\/p>\n You can see the berry in action below:<\/p>\n <\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The team plans to present their work at RobotSoft in April. And once the raspberry question is decided, they may move on to other berries, tomatoes, grapes&#8230; even apricots.

Now, the company offers inter-city rides, car ride-sharing, and corporate services in the 10 cities it operates in across Africa and the Middle East.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The partnership between Swvl and Queen\u2019s Gambit came from a mutual interest from both parties<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While searching for a company to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acquire<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl fit the blank-check company\u2019s criteria: strong business fundamentals, mobility and logistics (one of its core verticals), and an ESG ethos around women and affordable transportation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl &#8212; off the back of raising over $170 million in venture capital, expanding to over 16 countries across Latin America, Asia and Africa; hiring executives from Facebook, Uber and Optimus; and acquiring Shotl, Viapool and door2door &#8212; was on a quest for global dominance in the mobility space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A SPAC with Queen\u2019s Gambit was the most suitable option for it from a financial standpoint, and both parties feel strongly about the sustainability angle around transport &#8212; Swvl claims it has prevented approximately 289 million pounds of carbon emissions since its inception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company plans to expand into several countries over the next six months, including Colombia, Mexico, South Africa, and the U.S. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, all eyes will be on the company\u2019s performance as it <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">officially<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starts trading tomorrow in a cooling SPAC market and a generally unsettled public market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s a softness in the market, but as long as the company operates and delivers results, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maybe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today, people don\u2019t pay attention to it, but they will in months ahead,\u201d Grace said about the worrying SPAC and public markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the market will change <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like it always does and people go back to fundamentals at how we look at company\u2019s performances.

But with Minit, the tech giant is doubling down on a software category that could be worth over $11 billion by 2030, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wfmz.com\/news\/pr_newswire\/pr_newswire_technology\/global-process-mining-software-market-size-value-estimated-to-reach-usd-11-096-7-million\/article_a95b3354-ec2f-5389-b761-e4dbbdadbb97.html#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20report%20published,forecast%20period%202022%20to%202030.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according<\/a> to a report from Polaris Market Research.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292372\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear whether the whole of the Minit team will join Microsoft &#8212; or, indeed, whether the company will remain spread across its current locations. (Minit is now headquartered in Amsterdam, with satellite offices in London and New York.) But CEO James Dening said that customers shouldn&#8217;t expect a change in the level of support they&#8217;re currently receiving.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to what it means to become part of an industry leader like Microsoft and what that brings us &#8212; how we can use that scale and excellence to continue to deliver great solutions to our customers,&#8221; Dening wrote in a blog <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minit.io\/blog\/microsoft-minit-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post<\/a> on Minit&#8217;s website. &#8220;It has been a privilege to lead the company for the last year, and I\u2019m excited to continue my journey with the team, as part of what I consider to be the world\u2019s leading software company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Microsoft spokesperson Zara Huang told TechCrunch that the Minit team will move into the\u00a0<span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> Process Insights team and that there will be &#8220;no change&#8221; to the current work location of Minit team members. <span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> is in early stages of determining how Minit will be integrated into its offerings, she said, and the companies will share more details when they&#8217;re available.<\/p>\n<p>Minit, which was founded in 2015 by Rasto Hlavac and had raised \u20ac10.3 million (~$11.40 million) prior to the acquisition, is one of an expanding number of startups developing process mining tools aimed at enterprise clientele. Process mining, also known as task discovery, involves spotting root cause workflow issues and bottlenecks by pulling data from systems including desktop, email apps and workflows. It&#8217;s a key part of robotic process automation (RPA), a technology that promises to automate monotonous, repetitive tasks traditionally performed by human workers while at the same time generating logs to identify potential cost savings.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As Protocol&#8217;s Aisha Counts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/bulletins\/microsoft-process-mining-minit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notes<\/a>, process mining has traditionally been done by system integrators who map out processes by analyzing manual workflows. Process mining software is designed to digitize the approach in a way that reduces the expense, time and effort involved.<\/p>\n<p>Underlining the appetite for process mining technologies, Celonis, a data processing company, earlier this week acquired Minit competitor Process Analytics Factory, which coincidentally integrates with Microsoft&#8217;s Power BI analytics platform. Just in the past several years, RPA vendor Automation Anywhere acquired process discovery and mining startups FortressIQ, Process Gold\\ and StepShot; Blue Prism released a task mining solution called Capture; and rivals including ABBYY and Kryon have expanded their process mining offerings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/\">Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=wqSRCOP7wQ#?secret=2NKiKfcj0k\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;You know the process space is hot when even Microsoft, with its vast resources, has to buy its way in.

SAP acquired German process automation company Signavio in January 2021, just before ServiceNow got into the RPA segment with the buyout of India-based Intellibot.io.

been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robotics-roundup-12\/\">focused on pizza<\/a>. I\u2019ve long posited that this is for two key reasons. First: People like pizza. We eat a lot of it. Americans alone eat three billion pizzas a year. Second: It\u2019s relatively easy to make. The dough provides a fairly straightforward platform onto which ingredients are added.<\/p>\n<p>I say \u201cfairly\u201d here because there are still complications. There\u2019s really no such thing as easy when it comes to building robots that can execute variations on a task at a large scale. Here it\u2019s the dough that presents the problem. Turning a soft and malleable ball of dough into a pizza crust is one of those things humans have figured out how to do efficiently, but it still proves difficult for robot workers.<\/p>\n<p>A team of researchers at MIT, CMU and UC San Diego set out to create what they\u2019ve deemed \u201ccomplex dough-manipulation.\u201d The system is separated into a two-step process, in which the robot must first determine the task and then execute it using a tool like a rolling pin. The system, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2022\/robotic-deformable-object-0331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DiffSkill<\/a>, involves teaching robots complex tasks in simulations.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292473\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>MIT notes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A \u201cteacher\u201d algorithm solves each step the robot must take to complete the task. Then, it trains a \u201cstudent\u201d machine-learning model that learns abstract ideas about when and how to execute each skill it needs during the task, like using a rolling pin. With this knowledge, the system reasons about how to execute the skills to complete the entire task.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The researchers say the system outperformed those trained in the more traditional reinforcement learning model. \u201cOur framework provides a novel way for robots to acquire new skills. These skills can then be chained to solve more complex tasks which are beyond the capability of previous robot systems,\u201d says CSAIL grad student, Yunzhu Li.<\/p>\n<p>This is robotics, so the whole pizza thing is really an initial problem for a system designed to tackle a lot more tasks. The company points to the emerging field of eldercare robotics as a possible use going forward.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A disproportionate number of the early industrial food-making robots we\u2019ve seen have been focused on pizza.

make a dumb car"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Today&#8217;s cars are<\/span> dumb where they should be smart, and smart where they should be dumb. Enough already. Make a car that&#8217;s pretty much all dumb and watch it sell \u2014 because what automakers are giving people is so bad, they&#8217;ll pay more to have less of it.<\/p>\n<p>Cars now are like budget smartphones with wheels: loaded with bloatware, unintuitive and slow to operate. Carmakers have always struggled with user interfaces, but until recently the biggest problem we had was &#8220;too many knobs.&#8221; How I long for those days!<\/p>\n<p>The proliferation of touchscreens and LCDs has made every car feel like a karaoke booth. Animations show reclaimed energy from braking, the speedometer changes color as you approach the limit, the fan speed and direction is under three menus. And besides being non-functional, these interfaces are even ugly! The type, the layouts, and animations scream &#8220;designed by committee and approved by someone who doesn&#8217;t have to use it.&#8221;<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2254038\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Not to mention the privacy and security concerns. I was dubious the first time I saw a GPS in a car, my mom&#8217;s old RX300, about 20 years ago. &#8220;Yeah&#8230; that&#8217;s how they get you,&#8221; I thought. And now, Teslas with missed payments drive themselves to be impounded. Welcome to the future \u2014 your car is a narc now!<\/p>\n<p>The final indignity is that these features are being sold as upscale, not downmarket, options. Screens are so cheap that you can buy a few million and use them everywhere, for everything, and tell buyers &#8220;enjoy the next generation of mobility!&#8221; But in reality it&#8217;s a cost-saving measure that cuts down on part numbers and lets your dashboard team kick the can down the road as often as they want. You know this for sure because high-end models are going back to knobs and dials for that &#8220;premium feel.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s what I would like: a dumb car. This is what I think that looks like.<\/p>\n<h3>Dare to be stupid<\/h3>\n<p>First of all: no screens whatsoever. This is for a couple reasons, both practical and aesthetic.<\/p>\n<p>Practically speaking, nearly all of what these screens do is already performed by smartphones. There&#8217;s no need for a deeply outdated, laggy, manufacturer-branded Spotify or Apple Music app, your phone does it perfectly already. Navigation, similarly, is handled perfectly by the phone. Both of these, I need hardly add, already work fine with voice commands, too.<\/p>\n<p>Not having GPS or data (or hidden microphones or cameras) also makes your vehicle feel more private, obviously. Sure, they can still get your phone, but at least they&#8217;ll need to put a GPS package on your undercarriage like the old days if they want to track your movements beyond that.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2263916\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dumb-car-dash4.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2263916\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2263916\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dumb-car-dash4.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a dashboard of an older car.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dumb-car-dash4.jpg 3200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dumb-car-dash4.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dumb-car-dash4.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dumb-car-dash4.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dumb-car-dash4.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dumb-car-dash4.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dumb-car-dash4.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/dumb-car-dash4.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2263916\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Bryce Durbin \/ TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>For media, an aux input does it all. Doubles as a charging cable, and you could easily swap it out for different and new devices. Include a bit of smart cable routing and your phone can conveniently be mounted in a number of places around the cockpit \u2014 not that you should be looking at it or touching it (use your words). If you want Bluetooth, I&#8217;ve got a dongle for you. The only thing the car should have is a volume dial, maybe a three-button basic playback control cluster on the wheel.<\/p>\n<p>As for the climate controls on those big center LCDs, a couple knobs will do it. No one really believes these &#8220;zone&#8221; things work, right? No car is big enough to have zones in it. A blue-to-red dial, blower select, and A\/C and recirculate toggles get it done just fine.<\/p>\n<p>In the instrument cluster, we can have ordinary needle gauges. Speed, fuel, oil, temperature, and the usual idiot lights: check engine, low tire pressure, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Aesthetically, the digital versions of these have always bothered me. Drivers are meant to be focused on the road, but these clusters often have distracting, bright information that&#8217;s constantly changing. The difference between 69 and 70 on a gauge is an eighth of an inch, just like the difference between 67 and 68, and 68 and 69. That continuous, predictable variation is intuitive and precise enough for pretty much any driving purpose. On a digital display the numbers are blinky and big, constantly drawing your eye as they dip from 71 to 69, numbers that look completely different and you can&#8217;t really check out of the corner of your eye.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep it simple, keep it safe<\/h3>\n<p>Losing the media and navigation means we can do without a lot of the computation capability that goes into a modern car, but we don&#8217;t want to go without it entirely. There are safety features introduced in the last few years that ought to be included on every new car, smart or dumb. Traction control, blind spot and lane exit warnings, and even automatic emergency braking require a certain amount of CPU power and they should get it, because they save lives. Backup cameras are one thing people may not want to go without (and indeed may be required in some cases) \u2014 but you&#8217;d be surprised how informative a basic proximity beeper is.<\/p>\n<p>The engine itself is also far more computerized than in the old days. Unlike the computerization of the cabin, however, this has many positive effects, such as improved mileage, lower emissions, better reliability, and easier diagnosis for servicing. The exact level of electronics required for safe, responsive pedals and steering are probably a matter of some debate, but we can leave that to the experts.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m tempted to ask for manual window knobs and door locks, but that would put us over the line into affectation (if indeed we have not already left that line far behind). We&#8217;re not trying to recreate vintage cars but to make a modern one stripped of superfluous technology. Power seat adjustment, though, that&#8217;s a luxury even today. Use the lever.<\/p>\n<p>Note that nothing I&#8217;ve proposed is specific to gas-powered cars; electric vehicles are just as prone to these bad decisions as the rest. This isn&#8217;t about nostalgia but rather abandoning a pernicious yet universally followed design philosophy. (&#8230;Okay, it is a little about nostalgia, but only a little.)<\/p>\n<p>Of course what I&#8217;m describing, despite its seeming simplicity, probably amounts to something like a luxury vehicle, in that it&#8217;s not aiming at minimizing cost. Nearly every existing car line is designed with the &#8220;latest&#8221; tech in mind and to do away with that is a major departure from existing molds, assembly work, QA, and so on. Plus while I think the concept would attract many, it still wouldn&#8217;t outsell much. It&#8217;s a niche vehicle for sure, and the price would reflect that.<\/p>\n<p>Still, all I want is a car that isn&#8217;t as overbearing as all the rest of the devices I already own, sending me notifications, dinging, reporting errors, asking permissions, needing updates \u2014 my god! Leaving aside the whole spurious &#8220;back in my day&#8221; argument, there simply isn&#8217;t much point to these features now, certainly not enough to justify their prominence or poor quality. Let&#8217;s see what it&#8217;s like to make a car that focuses on letting the driver drive, and accommodating rather than trying to replace the supercomputers we all carry around in our pockets.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today&#8217;s cars are dumb where they should be smart, and smart where they should be dumb.

href=\"https:\/\/www.atg.wa.gov\/news\/news-releases\/ag-ferguson-investigation-shuts-down-amazon-price-fixing-program-nationwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pay $2.25 million and permanently shut down<\/a> a previously suspended sales program, following an investigation and lawsuit by the attorney general of Washington alleging it was essentially price fixing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sold By Amazon&#8221; basically worked like this. Amazon would contact a third-party seller and they would agree on a minimum price for an item. If Amazon sold the item for more, they would split the profits. In a way it&#8217;s not so different from buying a bunch of stuff wholesale and reselling it. But due to how Amazon dynamically prices and presents items in the store, that&#8217;s not quite what happened.<\/p>\n<p>As the AG&#8217;s office explains, Amazon ended up increasing the price of the items to match other retailers, and prevented sellers from offering discounts. As a result, buyers were frequently driven to purchase Amazon&#8217;s own brands, which it could price however it chose:<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2263528\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<blockquote><p>Prices for the vast majority of the remaining products enrolled in the \u201cSold by Amazon\u201d program stabilized at artificially high levels.<\/p>\n<p>&#8230;When prices increased, some sellers experienced a marked decline in the sales and resulting profits from products enrolled in the program. Faced with price increases, online customers sometimes opted to buy Amazon\u2019s own branded products \u2014 particularly its private label products. This resulted in Amazon maximizing its own profits regardless of whether consumers paid a higher price for sales of products enrolled in the \u201cSold by Amazon\u201d program or settled for buying the same or similar product offered through Amazon.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Sounds like a bad deal for sellers, but more fundamentally, Washington AG Bob Ferguson alleged that the practice was in violation of state antitrust laws. Amazon may be a store, but it also sells its own goods, making it a competitor with the third-party sellers in question. And two competitors making a secret agreement controlling the cost of goods is pretty much the definition of price fixing.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon disputed the AG&#8217;s characterization, saying it was all for the good of the customer and completely on the level. It also claimed to have shut down the program for &#8220;business reasons unrelated to the AG\u2019s investigation.&#8221; &#8220;While we strongly believe the program was legal, we\u2019re glad to have this matter resolved,&#8221; the company said in a statement to TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an extraordinary coincidence, then, that a program that had been expanding since 2018 would shut down almost immediately after antitrust authorities started sniffing around. &#8220;We launched the investigation in March 2020 and Amazon suspended the program in June,&#8221; said the AG office&#8217;s Dan Jackson. Perhaps it was just time.<\/p>\n<p>At any rate, rather than fight the lawsuit in court, Amazon agreed to a consent decree requiring the $2.25 million payment (which will go directly to funding the AG&#8217;s antitrust division) and prohibiting Amazon from reactivating the program in any way, shape or form.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Consumers lose when corporate giants like Amazon fix prices to increase their profits. Today\u2019s action promotes product innovation and consumer choice, and makes the market more competitive for sellers in Washington state and across the country,&#8221; said Ferguson.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amazon must pay $2.25 million and permanently shut down a previously suspended sales program, following an investigation and lawsuit by the attorney general of Washington alleging it was essentially price fixing. &#8220;Sold By Amazon&#8221; basically worked like this.

orders online shop to pay $4M for hiding reviews below 4 stars"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">We all know online reviews must be taken with a grain of salt, but generally you&#8217;d like to think that a product with a 4.5-star average is better than one with a 3.5-star average. You might be wrong, since the site you&#8217;re looking at <em>might not even permit bad reviews to appear<\/em> \u2014 like Fashion Nova, which just incurred a $4.2 million settlement order from the FTC.<\/p>\n<p>What happened was this: Fashion Nova used a third-party review management tool, which is surely a common thing for anyone running a site that lets users review the items they buy. But then they did a bad thing: from 2015 to 2019, they had 4- and 5-star reviews appear automatically on the site, while anything lower than that would require approval. And they didn&#8217;t approve <em>hundreds of thousands<\/em> of them, artificially inflating the perceived quality of the goods on the site.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Fashion Nova misrepresented that the reviews on its website accurately reflected the views of all purchasers who submitted reviews to the website. The proposed settlement puts provisions in place to address Fashion Nova\u2019s deceptive practice and orders Fashion Nova to pay $4.2 million for harm consumers incurred,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/blogs\/business-blog\/2022\/01\/abracadabra-bad-reviews-be-gone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote the FTC<\/a> in a blog post explaining the situation.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2262289\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>You can see the various documents related to the case <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/enforcement\/cases-proceedings\/192-3138\/fashion-nova-llc-matter\">here<\/a>. (Fashion Nova disputed the allegations in a statement describing all this as essentially an accident.)<\/p>\n<p>It seems the agency caught the scent of other scams like this being perpetrated under the auspices of third-party review platforms, since it has since sent letters of warning to 10 other (like the original, unnamed) companies that operate them. And it made<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/press-releases\/2021\/10\/ftc-puts-hundreds-businesses-notice-about-fake-reviews-other\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> a broader &#8220;watch yourself&#8221; announcement<\/a> back in October regarding fake reviews and deceptive endorsements.<\/p>\n<p>In case you&#8217;re worried Fashion Nova is just an innocent victim here, it is worth noting that this isn&#8217;t the company&#8217;s first brush with the feds, as back in 2020 it agree to pay $9 million over shady cancellation and return policies. Caveat emptor! (Sadly, it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/27\/ftc-smacks-down-robocallers-but-the-penalties-dont-match-their-heinous-crimes\/\">whether these fines will be paid in full<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Separately, but probably timed to harmonize with this announcement, the FTC updated its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/tips-advice\/business-center\/guidance\/soliciting-paying-online-reviews-guide-marketers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">guidelines for marketers looking to pay for or solicit online reviews<\/a>. There are ways to to do it right, like being transparent and allowing both positive and negative reviews to appear once they have been solicited. And there are&#8230; other ways. And it issued new guidance for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/tips-advice\/business-center\/guidance\/featuring-online-customer-reviews-guide-platforms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">platforms <em>publishing<\/em> reviews<\/a> that they should think twice about manipulating the source, incentives or visibility of reviews to their own advantage.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Fake reviews are a plague on the online economy, but so far either no one has solved the problem or the cure is \u2014 for retailers \u2014 worse than the disease, like it requires lots of work or the collapse of various lucrative arrangements. Perhaps this little flex by the FTC will help nudge them in the right direction.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"mNzfUmd0KV\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/15\/ftc-may-consider-rule-curbing-algorithmic-discrimination-and-commercial-surveillance\/\">FTC may consider rule curbing algorithmic discrimination and &#8216;commercial surveillance&#8217;<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;FTC may consider rule curbing algorithmic discrimination and &#8216;commercial surveillance&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/15\/ftc-may-consider-rule-curbing-algorithmic-discrimination-and-commercial-surveillance\/embed\/#?secret=bPRnenByqQ#?secret=mNzfUmd0KV\" data-secret=\"mNzfUmd0KV\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We all know online reviews must be taken with a grain of salt, but generally you&#8217;d like to think that a product with a 4.5-star average is better than one with a 3.5-star average.

billion parameters no one would claim it&#8217;s particularly streamlined. The Allen Institute for AI (AI2) has demonstrated a model that performs as well or better than GPT-3 on answering questions, but is a tenth the size.<\/p>\n<p>Macaw, AI2&#8217;s model, emerged from research being done at the nonprofit into creating an AI that performs at human levels on standardized tests.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;After we got a very high score they moved on to harder questions,&#8221; said AI2 head Oren Etzioni. &#8220;There&#8217;s this paradox where sometimes the questions that are easiest for people are the hardest for machines \u2014 and the biggest gap was in common sense.&#8221;<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2261479\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>For instance, he said, asking &#8220;When did Tom Hanks land on the moon?&#8221; GPT-3 says 1995, since that&#8217;s when the film Apollo 13 came out. But Macaw correctly notes that, as far as we know, Tom Hanks has in fact never been to the moon.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/macaw.apps.allenai.org\/\">AI2 has published a collection of examples<\/a> (&#8220;demo&#8221; is probably too strong a word) that illustrate the difference, with Macaw often providing the better answer to a variety of tricky and not-so-tricky questions.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s humorous to compare the two, as sometimes they both miss or give absurd answers at a pretty high rate. Macaw is good at tracking who did what, but is convinced snakes have legs. GPT-3&#8217;s answers are confident (perhaps overly so) and readable, even when they amount to conspiracy theories like that COVID-19 is &#8220;a new, experimental, and potentially dangerous drug.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A couple examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>How would you make a marriage stronger?<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Macaw<\/strong>: Communicate<br \/>\n<strong>GPT-3<\/strong>: I would make sure that I was the one who was always right.<\/li>\n<li><em>If a bird didn&#8217;t have wings, how would it be affected?<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Macaw<\/strong>: It would be unable to fly<br \/>\n<strong>GPT-3<\/strong>: It would be a bad bird.<\/li>\n<li><em>You poured yourself a glass of cranberry juice, but then absentmindedly, you poured about a teaspoon of grape juice into it. It looks OK. You try sniffing it, but you have a bad cold, so you can\u2019t smell anything. You are very thirsty. So you drink it. What happens next?<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Macaw<\/strong>: You get sick<br \/>\n<strong>GPT-3<\/strong>: You will probably die<\/li>\n<li><em>How does a snake move around?<\/em><br \/>\n<strong>Macaw<\/strong>: By slithering on all fours<br \/>\n<strong>GPT-3<\/strong>: Snakes move by using their muscles to push against the ground. They can move in any direction, but they cannot move backwards.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Clearly there&#8217;s still a ways to go in creating a question-answering AI that doesn&#8217;t trip up on basic questions that a child could answer. But it&#8217;s also worth noting that Macaw achieves a similar level of success with a far, far less data-intensive process. Etzioni was clear that this is not meant to be a GPT-3 replacement in any way, just another step in the research going on worldwide to advance the ball on language generation and understanding.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;GPT-3 is amazing, but it only came out 18 months ago, and access is limited,&#8221; he said. The capabilities it demonstrated are remarkable, &#8220;But we&#8217;re learning you can do more with less. Sometimes you have to build something with 175 billion parameters to say, well, maybe we can do this with 10 billion.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A good question-answering AI isn&#8217;t just good for party tricks, but is central to things like voice-powered search. A local model that can answer simple questions quickly and correctly without consulting outside sources is fundamentally valuable, and it&#8217;s unlikely your Amazon Echo is going to run GPT-3 \u2014 it would be like buying a semi truck to go to the grocery store with. Large scale models will continue to be useful, but pared-down ones will likely be the ones being deployed.<\/p>\n<p>A part of Macaw not on display, but being actively pursued by the AI2 team, is explaining the answer. Why does Macaw think snakes have legs? If it can&#8217;t explain that, it&#8217;s hard to figure out where the model went wrong. But Etzioni said that this is an interesting and difficult process on its own.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The problem with explanations is they can be really misleading,&#8221; he said. He cited an example where Netflix &#8220;explains&#8221; why it recommended a show to a viewer \u2014 but it&#8217;s not the real explanation, which has to do with complex statistical models. People don&#8217;t want to hear what&#8217;s relevant to the machine but rather to their own mind.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Our team is building these bona fide explanations,&#8221; said Etzioni, noting they had published some work but that it isn&#8217;t ready for public consumption.<\/p>\n<p>However, like most stuff AI2 builds, Macaw is open source. If you&#8217;re curious about it, <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/allenai\/macaw\">the code is here to play with<\/a>, so go to town.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OpenAI&#8217;s impressive AI language model GPT-3 has plenty of things going it, but with 175 billion parameters no one would claim it&#8217;s particularly streamlined.

reading every year. The space agency&#8217;s research trickles down to the rest of the world in surprising and interesting ways, which it tracks and collects in this annual publication. This year is no different, and NASA tech can be found in everything from hiking gadgets to heavy industry and, funnily enough, space.<\/p>\n<p>There are dozens of technologies that have made their way to everyday use in a variety of places <a href=\"https:\/\/spinoff.nasa.gov\/Spinoff-2022-release\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">highlighted in this year&#8217;s issue<\/a>, which you can <a href=\"https:\/\/spinoff.nasa.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2022-01\/Spinoff.2022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">browse here<\/a>. (It&#8217;s about 60 pages, so pour some coffee and settle in.)<\/p>\n<p>I talked with Daniel Lockney, the head of NASA&#8217;s Tech Transfer Program overseeing the deployment of its tech and research among terrestrial companies looking to put it to good use.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2261213\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Typically what happens is: NASA develops something, they report it to my office, and we look at it to figure out, first, does it work? And second, who else can use it? And if someone can, we figure out how to get it to them,&#8221; Lockney explained. &#8220;I try to give as much away for free as I can. I&#8217;ve got no direction to generate revenue or bring something back to the U.S. Treasury. The 1958 NASA act that created us says to disseminate our work \u2014 nothing in there about making a dime.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The result is cheap or free licensing of interesting tech like compact, long-lasting water filters, unusual mechanical components and other tech that was needed for space or launch purposes but might find a second use on the ground.<\/p>\n<p>Lockney highlighted a couple items in the latest batch that he thought were especially interesting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There was a partnership with GM to develop the Robo-Glove, a functional glove that astronauts will wear to help reduce strain during repetitive tasks and increase grip strength,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Squeezing something on a spacewalk, you can do it a couple times, but if you&#8217;re gripping a tool for the whole afternoon&#8230; so we developed this glove to assist in that work, and now it&#8217;s being used at factories around the world.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2261392\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/bioservo.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2261392\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2261392\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/bioservo.jpg\" alt=\"Two images of people wearing a robotic glove at work.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"502\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/bioservo.jpg 1249w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/bioservo.jpg?resize=150,73 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/bioservo.jpg?resize=300,147 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/bioservo.jpg?resize=768,376 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/bioservo.jpg?resize=680,333 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/bioservo.jpg?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2261392\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Bioservo Technologies<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The Swiss company Bioservo licensed the NASA patents for Robo-Glove and has been iterating on the concept for years, and the latest version of its Ironhand device came out last summer. Its most common use case is by employees with hand injuries that might cause them to lose work, but can use the glove to return to the job faster, as well as reduce pain medication.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not always just a single company licensing a tech. Lockney noted how NASA was the first organization to look into the question of precision agriculture under totally artificial conditions.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;NASA has a lot of experiments for keeping crews healthy on long distance spaceflight. One thing we have to do is grow our own food, plus there&#8217;s the psychological benefits of seeing plants,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But we needed to find ways to grow crops without a heavy growing medium like soil, or even hydroponics \u2014 water is so heavy, and so valuable. And you have to get the lighting right, but you can&#8217;t use too much energy. So we made these farming techniques to grow a lot of plants in a small space. If you control the plants&#8217; stress, you can really dial in precision growth conditions and improve yield; we actually use a nutritive film that covers the roots, LEDs to give the right spectrum of light and of course there&#8217;s sensors everywhere.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a similar situation in cities, how do you provide food to this population without the resource waste of farmland? But we led this research because no one else had the need for it \u2014 it ended up being the direct result of the demands of spaceflight. And now there are a handful of companies doing vertical farms in dense urban areas, actually providing grocery stores with vegetables,&#8221; he continued.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve actually covered a few, and they&#8217;re still in early days, but the appetite is clearly there for both consumers and investors to have food grown efficiently and within a few blocks of them rather than shipped a thousand miles overseas.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lnx1Ypnt8p\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/10\/on-ten-years-of-the-vertical-farm\/\">On 10 years of &#8216;The Vertical Farm&#8217;<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;On 10 years of &#8216;The Vertical Farm&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/10\/on-ten-years-of-the-vertical-farm\/embed\/#?secret=lnx1Ypnt8p\" data-secret=\"lnx1Ypnt8p\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>NASA work makes its way to leisure as well as life-sustaining industries. At least three of the items in this year&#8217;s Spinoff have to do with outdoors activities like hiking and camping. One, a thin-film radiant barrier originally used to line spacecraft, has made its way to jackets by <a href=\"https:\/\/13-one.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">13-One<\/a> and others as a super-light insulating layer. Aerogel research from the &#8217;90s has made its way to new gear from Seattle-based Outdoor Research (a brand I covet when I walk by their store). And a material called NanoCeram is used in a new <a href=\"https:\/\/nkdlife.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">portable water filter bottle<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>One new application you wouldn&#8217;t expect to find in a publication about spinoff techs is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/13\/spacexs-falcon-heavy-rocket-to-deliver-an-astrobotic-lander-and-nasa-water-hunting-rover-to-the-moon-in-2023\/\">Astrobotic&#8217;s Peregrine moon lander<\/a>. In the past such things have been exclusively the domain of nationally backed programs, but with the commercial space sector expanding quickly, NASA tech is valuable to spacefaring companies as well.<\/p>\n<p>Not all of these are new \u2014 some are decades old and still finding new applications or companies to sell them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By the time we&#8217;ve done all the work and we&#8217;ve found a partner doing the commercial stuff, manufacturing, marketing&#8230;. next thing you know, 10 years have passed,&#8221; Lockney said. &#8220;The R&amp;D timeline is long and the commercialization timeline is long.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But that means there&#8217;s always something fresh coming out even when the papers or materials are years old. There are dozens more techs and companies worth looking at in this year&#8217;s Spinoff, so take a look.

weekend of an online pharmacy selling over a hundred generic drugs at near cost was totally unexpected but will likely be welcomed by millions who struggle to afford medication. The billionaire told TechCrunch that the business model is refreshingly simple: &#8220;Lower pricing reduces patient stress, and that will lead to more customers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/costplusdrugs.com\">The Cost Plus Drug Company<\/a> aims very simply to provide as many common medications as possible in generic form at as low a price as possible. All cash, no IP deals, no insurance companies \u2014 just buy pills for what they cost to make, plus 15 percent to cover overhead.<\/p>\n<p>Asked about ROI, Cuban admitted there isn&#8217;t much to speak of, by design.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2261311\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;I want to be above break even while maximizing the number of people who can afford their medications,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Shoot. I would be happy if we can make a little, but push pricing of generics sold elsewhere down significantly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our challenge is to keep pushing prices lower,&#8221; not compete with anyone, he continued. &#8220;Our KPI is how much we can reduce the stress of our patients who buy generic meds. When people save a lot of money on their medications, they often will tell others they know that have the same challenges. That word of mouth impacts our growth the most.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company currently offers generic versions of medications <a href=\"https:\/\/costplusdrugs.com\/medications\/\">for everything from migraines to HIV to birth control<\/a>, but there&#8217;s no particular priority to the ones on the list except that they can and should be offered cheaper, explained Cuban. There&#8217;s no board deciding which conditions are next on the list or anything like that.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As far as the process, we choose drugs that we can offer at a price that is lower than what is out there already,&#8221; he said simply. &#8220;It&#8217;s like any business.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The ultra-straightforward business plan of undercutting middle men and offering a proven product for a better price than anyone else seems almost quaint today, but Cuban knows what he&#8217;s doing \u2014 in a generic way, at least. Asked what advice he had for any startups looking to get into the online pharmacy space, he offered a virtual shrug: &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any.

leaps into the supercomputer game with its AI Research SuperCluster"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">There&#8217;s a global competition to build the biggest, most powerful computers on the planet, and Meta (AKA Facebook) is about to jump into the melee with the <a href=\"https:\/\/ai.facebook.com\/blog\/ai-rsc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&#8220;AI Research SuperCluster,&#8221; or RSC<\/a>. Once fully operational, it may well sit in the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world, which it will use for the massive number crunching needed for language and computer vision modeling.<\/p>\n<p>Large AI models, of which OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3 is probably the best known, don&#8217;t get put together on laptops and desktops; they&#8217;re the final product of weeks and months of sustained calculations by high-performance computing systems that dwarf even the most cutting-edge gaming rig. And the faster you can complete the training process for a model, the faster you can test it and produce a new and better one. When training times are measured in months, that really matters.<\/p>\n<p>RSC is up and running and the company&#8217;s researchers are already putting it to work&#8230; with user-generated data, it must be said, though Meta was careful to say that it is encrypted until training time and the whole facility is isolated from the wider internet.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2260829\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The team that put RSC together is rightly proud at having pulled this off almost entirely remotely \u2014 supercomputers are surprisingly physical constructions, with base considerations like heat, cabling and interconnect affecting performance and design. Exabytes of storage sound big enough digitally, but they actually need to exist somewhere too, on site and accessible at a microsecond&#8217;s notice. (Pure Storage is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.purestorage.com\/company\/newsroom\/press-releases\/pure-partners-with-meta-on-ai-research-supercluster.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">also proud of the setup they put together for this<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>RSC is currently 760 Nvidia DGX A100 systems with a total 6,080 GPUs, which Meta claims should put it approximately in competition with Perlmutter at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. That&#8217;s the fifth most powerful supercomputer in operation right now, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.top500.org\/lists\/top500\/2021\/11\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according to longtime ranking site Top 500<\/a>. (No. 1 is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.r-ccs.riken.jp\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fugaku<\/a> in Japan by a long shot, in case you&#8217;re wondering.)<\/p>\n<p>That could change as the company continues building out the system. Ultimately they plan for it to be about three times more powerful, which would in theory put it in the running for third place.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fZnykn1tDSE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s arguably a caveat in there. Systems like second-place Summit at Lawrence Livermore National Lab are employed for research purposes, where precision is at a premium. If you&#8217;re simulating the molecules in a region of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere at unprecedented detail levels, you need to take every calculation out to a whole lot of decimal points. And that means those calculations are more computationally expensive.<\/p>\n<p>Meta explained that AI applications don&#8217;t require a similar degree of precision, since the results don&#8217;t hinge on that thousandth of a percent \u2014 inference operations end up producing things like &#8220;90% certainty this is a cat,&#8221; and if that number were 89% or 91% wouldn&#8217;t make a big difference. The difficulty is more about achieving 90% certainty for a million objects or phrases rather than a hundred.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an oversimplification, but the result is that RSC, running TensorFloat-32 math mode, can get more FLOP\/s (floating point operations per second) per core than other, more precision-oriented systems. In this case it&#8217;s up to 1,895,000 teraFLOP\/s, or 1.9 exaFLOP\/s, more than 4x Fugaku&#8217;s. Does that matter? And if so, to whom? If anyone, it might matter to the Top 500 folks, so I&#8217;ve asked if they have any input on it. But it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that RSC will be among the fastest computers in the world, perhaps the fastest to be operated by a private company for its own purposes.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There&#8217;s a global competition to build the biggest, most powerful computers on the planet, and Meta (AKA Facebook) is about to jump into the melee with the &#8220;AI Research SuperCluster,&#8221; or RSC.

And sometimes they&#8217;re loopholes in existing rules, where an ISP arranges things so that it would be prohibitively expensive for a competitor to share infrastructure.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2260800\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The new proposal, circulated internally today by FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel but summarized in a release, would prevent or mitigate some of these dirty tricks. It would ban revenue sharing agreements outright, require other arrangements (like marketing) to be disclosed to tenants and close loopholes that allow wiring to be effectively exclusive when it is meant to be leased or shared.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With more than one-third of the U.S. population living in apartments, mobile home parks, condominiums, and public housing, it\u2019s time to crack down on practices that lock out broadband competition and consumer choice,&#8221; said Rosenworcel. &#8220;Consumers deserve access to a choice of providers in their buildings. I look forward to having my colleagues join me in lifting the obstacles to competitive choice for broadband for the millions of tenants across the nation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The Commission recently began looking into the issue, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/document\/fcc-seeks-comment-broadband-access-multi-tenant-buildings-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">opening a comment period<\/a> and investigating the evidence \u2014 not surprisingly, they found &#8220;a pattern of new practices that inhibit competition, contrary to the Commission\u2019s goals, and limit opportunities for competitive providers to offer service for apartment, condo and office building unit tenants.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Rosenworcel&#8217;s current proposal is the result of t1his \u2014 not a sweeping new rule but a bit of problem solving aimed squarely at bad faith activity commonly undertaken by ISPs. The proposal will be made public at some point ahead of the FCC&#8217;s vote \u2014 and even if that was tomorrow, there would likely be a considerable grace period before any of these shady arrangements are revised. So if you&#8217;re hoping to switch providers soon somewhere you&#8217;ve got no choice&#8230; keep hoping. But maybe next year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most anyone who&#8217;s moved to a new apartment has had the same experience: Whatever broadband provider everyone else in the building has, you have.

researchers build an AI that learns equally well from visual, written or spoken materials"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Advances in the AI realm are constantly coming out, but they tend to be limited to a single domain: For instance, a cool new method for producing synthetic speech isn&#8217;t <em>also<\/em> a way to recognize expressions on human faces. Meta (AKA Facebook) researchers are working on something a little more versatile: an AI that can learn capably on its own whether it does so in spoken, written or visual materials.<\/p>\n<p>The traditional way of training an AI model to correctly interpret something is to give it lots and lots (like millions) of labeled examples. A picture of a cat with the cat part labeled, a conversation with the speakers and words transcribed, etc. But that approach is no longer in vogue as researchers found that it was no longer feasible to manually create databases of the sizes needed to train next-gen AIs. Who wants to label 50 million cat pictures? Okay, a few people probably \u2014 but who wants to label 50 million pictures of common fruits and vegetables?<\/p>\n<p>Currently some of the most promising AI systems are what are called self-supervised: models that can work from large quantities of unlabeled data, like books or video of people interacting, and build their own structured understanding of what the rules are of the system. For instance, by reading a thousand books it will learn the relative positions of words and ideas about grammatical structure without anyone telling it what objects or articles or commas are \u2014 it got it by drawing inferences from lots of examples.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2259820\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>This feels intuitively more like how people learn, which is part of why researchers like it. But the models still tend to be single-modal, and all the work you do to set up a semi-supervised learning system for speech recognition won&#8217;t apply at all to image analysis \u2014 they&#8217;re simply too different. That&#8217;s where Facebook\/Meta&#8217;s latest research,<a href=\"https:\/\/ai.facebook.com\/research\/data2vec-a-general-framework-for-self-supervised-learning-in-speech-vision-and-language\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> the catchily named data2vec<\/a>, comes in.<\/p>\n<p>The idea for data2vec was to build an AI framework that would learn in a more abstract way, meaning that starting from scratch, you could give it books to read or images to scan or speech to sound out, and after a bit of training it would learn any of those things. It&#8217;s a bit like starting with a single seed, but depending on what plant food you give it, it grows into an daffodil, pansy or tulip.<\/p>\n<p>Testing data2vec after letting it train on various data <del>corpi<\/del> corpora showed that it was competitive with and even outperformed similarly sized dedicated models for that modality. (That is to say, if the models are all limited to being 100 megabytes, data2vec did better \u2014 specialized models would probably still outperform it as they grow.)<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lSkDlkRHRU\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/09\/decades-old-ascii-adventure-nethack-may-hint-at-the-future-of-ai\/\">Decades-old ASCII adventure NetHack may hint at the future of AI<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Decades-old ASCII adventure NetHack may hint at the future of AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/09\/decades-old-ascii-adventure-nethack-may-hint-at-the-future-of-ai\/embed\/#?secret=lSkDlkRHRU\" data-secret=\"lSkDlkRHRU\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The core idea of this approach is to learn more generally: AI should be able to learn to do many different tasks, including those that are entirely unfamiliar,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/ai.facebook.com\/blog\/the-first-high-performance-self-supervised-algorithm-that-works-for-speech-vision-and-text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote the team in a blog post<\/a>. &#8220;We also hope data2vec will bring us closer to a world where computers need very little labeled data in order to accomplish tasks.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;People experience the world through a combination of sight, sound and words, and systems like this could one day understand the world the way we do,&#8221; commented CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the research.<\/p>\n<p>This is still early stage research, so don&#8217;t expect the fabled &#8220;general AI&#8221; to emerge all of a sudden \u2014 but having an AI that has a generalized learning structure that works with a variety of domains and data types seems like a better, more elegant solution than the fragmented set of micro-intelligences we get by with today.<\/p>\n<p>The code for data2vec is open source; <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/pytorch\/fairseq\/tree\/main\/examples\/data2vec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">it and some pretrained models are available here<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Advances in the AI realm are constantly coming out, but they tend to be limited to a single domain: For instance, a cool new method for producing synthetic speech isn&#8217;t also a way to recognize expressions on human faces.

lidar, IR, ultrasonic and so on. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.metalenz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Metalenz<\/a>, maker of highly compact &#8220;2D&#8221; cameras for advanced sensing, hopes to bring polarized light into the mix for security and safety with its PolarEyes tech.<\/p>\n<p>Polarization isn&#8217;t a quality of light that&#8217;s often paid much attention. It has to do with the orientation of the photon&#8217;s movement as it waves its way through the air, and generally you can get the info you need from light without checking its polarization. But that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s useless.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Polarization generally gets thrown out, but it really can tell you something about what the objects you&#8217;re looking at are made out of. And it can find contrast that normal cameras can&#8217;t see,&#8221; said Metalenz co-founder and CEO Rob Devlin. &#8220;In healthcare, it&#8217;s been used historically to tell whether a cell is cancerous or not \u2014 the color and intensity don&#8217;t change in the visible light, but looking at polarization it works.&#8221;<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2259538\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>But polarized light cameras are pretty much only found in medical or industrial settings where their specific qualities are needed, and therefore the devices that do it are fantastically expensive and rather large. Not the kind of thing you would want clipped to the top of your laptop screen, even if you could afford the six-figure price.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"l3gHD1WTVk\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/04\/metalenz-reimagines-the-camera-in-2d-and-raises-10m-to-ship-it\/\">Metalenz reimagines the camera in 2D and raises $10M to ship it<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Metalenz reimagines the camera in 2D and raises $10M to ship it&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/04\/metalenz-reimagines-the-camera-in-2d-and-raises-10m-to-ship-it\/embed\/#?secret=l3gHD1WTVk\" data-secret=\"l3gHD1WTVk\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The advance Metalenz made <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/04\/metalenz-reimagines-the-camera-in-2d-and-raises-10m-to-ship-it\/\">when I wrote about them last year<\/a> was reliably and inexpensively manufacturing the complex micro-scale 3D optical features to make a tiny but effective camera on a chip. These devices, Devlin said, are currently coming to market as part of an industrial 3D sensing module, partly in partnership with STMicroelectronics. But the polarization thing has more consumer-relevant applications.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Polarization in facial recognition tells you whether you&#8217;re looking at real human skin, or a silicone mask, or a high-quality photo or something. In automotive settings, you can detect black ice, it&#8217;s really difficult with normal cameras but it jumps out with polarization,&#8221; said Devlin.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of facial recognition, the unit could be small enough to sit alongside a normal camera in a front-facing array, like the lidar unit in iPhones that currently scans the face using tiny lasers. A polarized light sensor would instead (in this example) split the image into four, presumably corresponding to four different axes of polarization, each of which shows a slightly different version of the image. These differences can be evaluated the way the differences between images taken a small distance or time apart can, allowing the geometry and details of the face to be observed.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2259635\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/polar2-1.gif\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2259635\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2259635\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/polar2-1.gif\" alt=\"Polarized light is split into 4 streams, showing different details of a face.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"844\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2259635\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Metalenz<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Polarized light has the advantage of also being able to tell the difference between materials: skin reflects light differently than a realistic mask or photo. Perhaps this isn&#8217;t a common threat in your everyday life, but if a phone manufacturer could get the same &#8220;Face ID&#8221; type feature, with added anti-spoofing security, and use something less exotic than a tiny lidar unit, they&#8217;d probably jump on the opportunity. (And Metalenz is talking to the right people here.)<\/p>\n<p>The automotive and industrial side is also useful, as telling what a given pixel you&#8217;re looking at is made of is a surprisingly complex question that usually involves identifying the object it&#8217;s part of. But using polarization data you can tell the difference between lots of materials instantly \u2014 and in fact this is part of the value proposition of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/30\/voyant-raises-15m-to-scale-production-of-its-tiny-inexpensive-lidar-tech\/\">Voyant&#8217;s new lidar<\/a>.

there&#8221; \u2014 quickly becomes a complex, arguably impossible job once you get past a few buildings and cameras. Who can watch everywhere at once, and send someone in time to prevent a problem? <a href=\"https:\/\/ambient.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ambient.ai<\/a> isn&#8217;t the first to claim that AI can, but they may be the first to actually pull it off at scale \u2014 and they&#8217;ve raised $52 million to keep growing.<\/p>\n<p>The problem with today&#8217;s processes is the sort of thing anybody can point out. If you&#8217;ve got a modern company or school campus with dozens or hundreds of cameras, they produce so much footage and data that even a dedicated security team will have trouble keeping up with it. As a consequence, not only are they likely to miss an important event as it happens, but they&#8217;re also up to their ears in false alarms and noise.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Victims are always looking at the cameras, expecting that someone is coming to help them&#8230; but it just isn&#8217;t the case,&#8221; CEO and co-founder of Ambient.ai, Shikhar Shrestha, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Best case is you wait for the incident to happen, you go and pull the video, and you work from there. We have the cameras, we have the sensors, we have the officers \u2014 what&#8217;s missing is the brain in the middle.&#8221;<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2259148\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Obviously Shrestha&#8217;s company is looking to provide the brain: a central visual processing unit for live security footage that can tell when something&#8217;s going wrong and immediately tell the right people. But without the bias that threatens such endeavors, and no facial recognition.<\/p>\n<p>Others have made inroads on this particular idea before now, but so far none has seen serious adoption. The first generation of automatic image recognition, Shrestha said, was simple motion detection, little more than checking whether pixels were moving around on the screen \u2014 with no insight into whether it was a tree or a home invader. Next came the use of deep learning to do object recognition: identifying a gun in hand or a breaking window. This proved useful but limited and somewhat high maintenance, needing lots of scene- and object-specific training.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The insight was, if you look at what humans do to understand a video, we take lots of other information: is the person sitting or standing? Are they opening a door, are they walking or running? Are they indoors or outdoors, daytime or nighttime? We bring all that together to create a kind of comprehensive understanding of the scene,&#8221; Shrestha explained. &#8220;We use computer vision intelligence to mine the footage for a whole range of events. We break down every task and call it a primitive: interactions, objects, etc., then we combine those building blocks to create a &#8216;signature.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2259192\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-shot.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2259192\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2259192\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-shot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"728\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-shot.png 1440w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-shot.png?resize=150,107 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-shot.png?resize=300,213 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-shot.png?resize=768,546 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-shot.png?resize=680,484 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-shot.png?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2259192\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Ambient.ai system uses elements of behavior and plugs them into each other to tell whether they&#8217;re a problem. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Ambient.ai<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>A signature may be something like &#8220;a person sitting in their car for a long time at night,&#8221; or &#8220;a person standing by a security checkpoint not interacting with anyone,&#8221; or any number of things. Some have been tweaked and added by the team, some have been arrived at independently by the model, which Shrestha descrbed as &#8220;kind of a managed semi-supervised approach.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The benefit of using an AI to monitor a hundred video streams at once is plain even if you were to assume that said AI is only, say, 80% as good as a human at spotting something bad happening. With no such shortcomings as distraction, fatigue or only having two eyes, an AI can apply that level of success without limits on time or feed number, meaning the chance of success is actually quite high.<\/p>\n<p>But the same might have been said of a proto-AI system from a few years ago that was only looking for guns. What Ambient.ai is aiming for is something more comprehensive.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We built the platform around the idea of privacy by design,&#8221; Shrestha said. With AI-powered security, &#8220;people just assume facial recognition is part of it, but with our approach you have this large number of signature events, and you can have a risk indicator without having to do facial recognition. You don&#8217;t just have one image and one model that says what&#8217;s happening &#8212; we have all these different blocks that allow you to get more descriptive in the system.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Essentially this is done by keeping each individual recognized activity bias-free to begin with. For instance, whether someone is sitting or standing, or how long they&#8217;ve been waiting outside a door \u2014 if each of these behaviors can be audited and found to be detected across demographics and groups, then the sum of such inferences must likewise be free of bias. In this way the system structurally reduces bias.<\/p>\n<p>It must, however, be said that bias is insidious and complex, and our ability to recognize it and mitigate it lags behind the state of the art. Nevertheless it seems intuitively true that, as Shrestha put it, &#8220;if you don&#8217;t have an inference category for something that can be biased, there&#8217;s no way for bias to come in that way.&#8221; Let&#8217;s hope so!<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2259193\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-Founders.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2259193\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2259193\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-Founders.jpg\" alt=\"Ambient.ai co-founders Vikesh Khanna (CTO, left) and Shikhar Shrestha (CEO).\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-Founders.jpg 2880w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-Founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-Founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-Founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-Founders.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-Founders.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-Founders.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/ambientai-Founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2259193\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ambient.ai co-founders Vikesh Khanna (CTO, left) and Shikhar Shrestha (CEO). <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Ambient.ai<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>We&#8217;ve seen a few startups come and go along these lines, so it&#8217;s important for these ideas to be demonstrated on the record. And despite keeping relatively quiet about itself, Ambient.ai has a number of active customers that have helped prove out its product hypothesis. Of course the last couple years haven&#8217;t exactly been business as usual&#8230; but it&#8217;s hard to imagine &#8220;five of the largest U.S. tech companies by market cap&#8221; would be customers (and they are) if it didn&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n<p>One test at an unnamed &#8220;Fortune 500 Technology Company&#8221; was looking to reduce &#8220;tailgating,&#8221; where someone enters a secured area right behind another person authorized to do so. If you think no one does this, well, they identified 2,000 incidents the first week. But by sending GIFs of the events in near real time to security, who presumably went and wagged their fingers at the offenders, that number was reduced to 200 a week. Now it&#8217;s 10 a week, probably by people like me.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2259191\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/problems-ambientai.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2259191\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2259191\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/problems-ambientai.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of ambient.ai's interface, showing detected events like falls and active shooters.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"728\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/problems-ambientai.jpg 1440w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=300,213 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=768,546 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=680,484 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/problems-ambientai.jpg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2259191\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Ambient.ai<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In another test case Ambient.ai documented, a school&#8217;s security cameras caught someone scaling the fence after hours.

And the AI could also discern between climbing, falling and loitering, which in different circumstances might matter, or not.<\/p>\n<p>Ambient.ai claims that part of the system&#8217;s flexibility is in all these &#8220;primitives&#8221; being easy to rearrange depending on the needs of the site \u2014 maybe you truly don&#8217;t care if someone climbs a fence, unless they fall \u2014 as well as being able to learn new situations: &#8220;Ah, so this is what it looks like when someone is cutting a fence.&#8221; The team currently has about 100 suspicious behavior &#8220;signatures&#8221; and hopes to double that over the next year.<\/p>\n<p>Making the existing security personnel more effective by giving them more control over what blows up their phone or radio saves time and improves outcomes (Ambient.ai says it reduces the number of common alarms in general by 85-90%). And AI-powered categorization of footage helps with records and archives as well. Saying &#8220;download all footage of people climbing a fence at night&#8221; is a lot easier than scrubbing through 5,000 hours manually.<\/p>\n<p>The $52 million round was led by a16z, but there&#8217;s also a bit of a who&#8217;s-who in the individual investor pile: Ron Conway, Ali Rowghani from Y Combinator, Okta co-founder Frederic Kerrest, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, Microsoft CVP Charles Dietrich, and several others who know of what they invest in.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a unique time; security practitioners are expected to do a lot more. The basic proposal of not having to have someone watching all these feeds is universal,&#8221; said Shrestha. &#8220;We spend so much money on security, $120 billion&#8230; it&#8217;s crazy that the outcomes aren&#8217;t there \u2014 we don&#8217;t prevent incidents. It feels like all roads are leading to convergence. We want to be a platform that an organization can adopt and future-proof their security.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Security \u2014 as in &#8220;hey you, you can&#8217;t go in there&#8221; \u2014 quickly becomes a complex, arguably impossible job once you get past a few buildings and cameras.

challenges consolidation in tech with review of merger guidelines"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It&#8217;s a sign of the times that on the very same morning, the FTC and Justice Department <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/press-releases\/2022\/01\/ftc-and-justice-department-seek-to-strengthen-enforcement-against-illegal-mergers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced a thorough review of corporate merger policies<\/a> with an eye to preventing anti-competitive acquisitions \u2014 and a megacorp announced a $69 billion deal that would further consolidate an industry already dominated by a handful of players.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not to say that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/18\/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard\/\">the Microsoft-Activision deal<\/a> is necessarily anticompetitive, but they certainly will have their job cut out for them in proving that it isn&#8217;t. As a publisher, platform, hardware maker and service provider in gaming, Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard puts several of the world&#8217;s most popular gaming franchises firmly in its stable \u2014 and potentially out of arch-rival Sony&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe that&#8217;s just how competition works these days. But what this FTC review presupposes is&#8230; maybe it shouldn&#8217;t?<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2258923\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>What exactly the new rules are to be isn&#8217;t yet set, the announcement drew very obvious dotted lines around the areas the agencies are hoping to rein in without actually naming names. In fact (as is frequently but not always the process in recasting rules) public comment is called for on all matters, so the areas of focus are ostensibly notional, though one assumes they have a draft ready now. (In fact I suspect FTC Chair Lina Khan had it in her briefcase when she was confirmed.)<\/p>\n<p>The review would seek to revisit the conditions under which a merger or acquisition would be viewed with suspicion, such as whether it will &#8220;tend to create a monopoly,&#8221; a somewhat loose turn of phrase technically in the guidelines now but not very well defined.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"4d5KDeyvdT\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/30\/amazon-betrays-its-fear-with-petition-to-sideline-ftc-chair-and-antitrust-hawk-lina-khan\/\">Amazon betrays its fear with petition to sideline FTC Chair and antitrust hawk Lina Khan<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Amazon betrays its fear with petition to sideline FTC Chair and antitrust hawk Lina Khan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/30\/amazon-betrays-its-fear-with-petition-to-sideline-ftc-chair-and-antitrust-hawk-lina-khan\/embed\/#?secret=4d5KDeyvdT\" data-secret=\"4d5KDeyvdT\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Also under consideration would be the way markets themselves are defined, which is key to establishing anticompetitive practices. For instance, what market is Facebook in, legally speaking? Communications, &#8220;social media&#8221; (however we define that), advertising, or what? Unless that sort of thing is pinned down, companies can slip between the cracks, arguing one day that they&#8217;re an advertiser and the next that they&#8217;re a communications provider, usually whichever suits their needs for escaping regulation. (Broadband providers have been drawing out a similar advantageous vacillation for decades.)<\/p>\n<p>The FTC will also be looking at updating guidelines on &#8220;potential and nascent competitors,&#8221; the kind frequently snapped up for tens of billions of dollars when it looks like they can&#8217;t be contained any longer.<\/p>\n<p>Monopsony power and how it relates to labor markets is also being looked at, which is where one company (or more than one in collusion) dominates the market for buying a particular service. Say if Uber for some reason employs 90% of all personal transportation drivers in a state, what opportunities for leverage and abuse does that offer, and how can those be counteracted?<\/p>\n<p>The most explicit call-out, however, is certainly the final bullet on the list of items:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Unique characteristics of digital markets<\/strong>: The agencies seek information on how to account for key areas of the modern economy like digital markets in the guidelines, which often have characteristics like zero-price products, multi-sided markets, and data aggregation that the current guidelines do not address in detail.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What exactly is the effect of things like Amazon Prime, which despite being unquestionably convenient in many ways is part of a complex market and system of markets, and as such may prove problematic from a competition standpoint? Without the ability to even ask and answer such questions, Amazon will fall through the aforementioned cracks and its policies may be blindly accepted as beneficial upon superficial inquiry.<\/p>\n<p>Asking the general public whether they think a company amounts to a monopsony, or whether their acquisition of a competitor amounts is questionable, seems on the face of it a little unaccountable. But the public comment period does two things.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>First, it creates an opportunity for soliciting broad support from the public across the U.S., establishing the process as good politics. Some canny Representative may require a bit of convincing that their constituency cares about such things. Though as we saw with the net neutrality push, this is hardly sufficient to guarantee success.<\/p>\n<p>Second, it allows for real input from interested parties \u2014 trade associations, activists, NGOs, and so on \u2014 who can put together serious comments that make substantive policy and research suggestions. Having a basket of non-partisan think tanks to sprinkle in as footnotes justifying various approaches is a bulwark against rules being considered &#8220;arbitrary or capricious&#8221; and being nullified or challenged.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/public-statements\/2022\/01\/statement-chair-lina-m-khan-regarding-request-information-merger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A highly readable statement by Khan<\/a> summarizes the situation well and gives important context to the idea of updating rules \u2014 it&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve been doing all along, and it&#8217;s long past time we do it again. It&#8217;s hard to put it better than she does, with the directness that made her Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox paper so compelling:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Major technological and economic changes, meanwhile, have led to shifts in how businesses compete and grow, creating new interconnections and dynamics across multiple dimensions.<\/p>\n<p>Evidence suggests that decades of mergers have been a key driver of consolidation across industries, with this latest merger wave threatening to concentrate our markets further yet.<\/p>\n<p>While the current merger boom has delivered massive fees for investment banks, evidence suggests that many Americans historically have lost out, with diminished opportunity, higher prices, lower wages, and lagging innovation. 7 A lack of competition also appears to have left segments of our economy more brittle, as consolidated supply and reduced investment in capacity can render us less resilient in the face of shocks.<\/p>\n<p>Just as we must revise our theories and models to fit new facts and evidence, we must ensure our merger guidelines accurately reflect the realities of the modern economy. Matching our analysis to contemporary business strategy requires that our tools be dynamic and holistic rather than static and atomistic.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The comments are open now and will remain so for 60 days. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.regulations.gov\/docket\/FTC-2022-0003\/document\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Feel free to add your own<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"aSHXGdORyh\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/15\/ftc-may-consider-rule-curbing-algorithmic-discrimination-and-commercial-surveillance\/\">FTC may consider rule curbing algorithmic discrimination and &#8216;commercial surveillance&#8217;<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;FTC may consider rule curbing algorithmic discrimination and &#8216;commercial surveillance&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/15\/ftc-may-consider-rule-curbing-algorithmic-discrimination-and-commercial-surveillance\/embed\/#?secret=aSHXGdORyh\" data-secret=\"aSHXGdORyh\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s a sign of the times that on the very same morning, the FTC and Justice Department announced a thorough review of corporate merger policies with an eye to preventing anti-competitive acquisitions \u2014 and a megacorp announced a $69 billion deal that would further consolidate an industry already dominated by a handful of players.

It only puts out a handful of cameras every year, and most of them are remixes or minor iterations on previous models. Since 2017 its flagship has been the solid but still somewhat archaic M10, but now the company has revealed its successor: <a href=\"https:\/\/leica-camera.com\/en-US\/photography\/cameras\/m\/m11-black\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the even more solid and also still somewhat archaic M11<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Leica really defined the rangefinder style in cameras, and its film models are legendary. In the digital era they are known more for their prices than anything else. While the build and image quality of the M10, Q2 and other cameras was unimpeachable, you could get a lot more camera for considerably less money elsewhere. That won&#8217;t change with the M11, but at least the new model brings some much-needed modern features.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important is the switch to a backside-illuminated sensor. This misleading term refers to putting the light-sensitive part of the sensor toward the aperture rather than letting it sit behind wiring and other components. BSI sensors usually outperform their traditional predecessors by quite a lot, and Leica generally has a good sensor game to begin with. Interestingly, they seem to have chosen a non-Bayer sub-pixel layout with an eye toward superior pixel binning.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2257619\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The new full-frame, 60-megapixel BSI sensor can be shot at full resolution, of course, but hardly anyone needs that these days. The 36MP and 18MP options sample the entire sensor rather than just lines or regions, reducing noise and artifacts. If I got one of these I&#8217;d switch it to 36MP and never look back. There are also 1.3x and 1.8x crop modes for those who enjoy them.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2257658\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Leica_M11_black_02_cable_3840x1348.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2257658\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2257658\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Leica_M11_black_02_cable_3840x1348.jpg\" alt=\"A Leica M11 on a table plugged into a phone.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Leica_M11_black_02_cable_3840x1348.jpg 2500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Leica_M11_black_02_cable_3840x1348.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Leica_M11_black_02_cable_3840x1348.jpg?resize=300,135 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Leica_M11_black_02_cable_3840x1348.jpg?resize=768,345 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Leica_M11_black_02_cable_3840x1348.jpg?resize=680,306 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Leica_M11_black_02_cable_3840x1348.jpg?resize=1536,691 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Leica_M11_black_02_cable_3840x1348.jpg?resize=2048,921 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Leica_M11_black_02_cable_3840x1348.jpg?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2257658\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Leica<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>There are now three easily reassignable function buttons.

Having the camera essentially always in &#8220;live view&#8221; mode means accurate exposures, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dpreview.com\/reviews\/leica-m11-initial-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">but according to DPReview&#8217;s initial review<\/a>, it leads to longish startup times \u2014 and Leicas are generally quick as lightning to turn on and shoot with.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a USB-C port that charges the camera&#8217;s new and much larger battery, or to pull shots off the card or 64-gig internal memory \u2014 or to suck them directly onto your phone and a companion app (another reason not to shoot full rez).<\/p>\n<p>Leica&#8217;s M series is unique and definitely not an option for more hobby photographers, who will rightfully balk at the $8,995 price for the M11 body \u2014 the M10 debuted at $6,600 in 2017, and even adjusting for inflation the new price is eye-popping.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/ces-2022\/\">CES 2022<\/a> is in the bag for TechCrunch, and even though we attended the event remotely, one thing in the vehicle space was made abundantly clear: Your car is about so much more than mobility. In fact, if you think a vehicle is about getting you from point A to point B, think again, peasant!<\/p>\n<p>Your car \u2014 at least in the eyes of automakers and tech companies \u2014 is a third space, a place where you can work or lounge or watch TV. It\u2019s a device, connecting you with the other devices that run your life. It\u2019s an assistant, anticipating your needs by creepily watching you and collecting data on your every movement.<\/p>\n<p>The big themes this year focused on services and experiences that drivers and passengers can have inside vehicles, the advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving features that handle some of the drudgery of driving so you can have those experiences, and the compute power needed to deliver it all.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2254886\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Of course, there was other vehicle tech that popped up: Who can forget BMW\u2019s color-changing car? NFTs even made an appearance. Here\u2019s the in-vehicle tech that stood out to us.<\/p>\n<h2>Compute power for the win<\/h2>\n<p>We heard a lot about digital cockpits that transform the front cab into a world of digital content, entertainment and services. Many companies threw around the term \u201cco-pilot\u201d and depending on how that company defined it, the co-pilot could include voice assistants or even actual driver-assistance systems that can control certain functions of the vehicles. And there were deep insinuations that one should never, if one can help it, stop watching TV or streaming video \u2014 especially not when in a moving vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>All of that requires processing power and at 2022 CES the automotive chip game was on.<\/p>\n<h3>Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Digital Chassis<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2252834\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2252834\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2252834\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png\" alt=\"Qualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chassis render showing advanced connected infotainment system in vehicle\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2252834\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Qualcomm Technologies<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Qualcomm doubled down on its commitment to powering <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/04\/qualcomm-ces-auto-snapdragon-digital-chassis\/\">automotive in-vehicle tech<\/a> at CES 2022 by bringing on new OEM clients. The tech giant\u2019s Snapdragon Digital Chassis offers automakers a platter of cloud-connected \u201cplatforms\u201d consisting of systems on a chip (SoC) and software that can be adopted in full or \u00e0 la carte.<\/p>\n<p>The chassis includes: the Snapdragon Ride Platform for ADAS and automated driving, the Auto Connectivity Platform for LTE, 5G connected services, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning, and the next generation of the Snapdragon Cockpit, a digital cockpit and infotainment system.<\/p>\n<p>Volvo and Honda announced plans to integrate the digital cockpit into upcoming electric vehicles, and Renault, which has already committed to bringing the cockpit into future cars, expanded the partnership to include everything the chassis has to offer. General Motors will also be relying on Snapdragon to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/06\/gm-taps-qualcomm-to-power-new-hands-free-driver-assistance-starting-with-cadillac\/\">power its next-gen ADAS<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Nvidia\u2019s Drive Orin SoC<\/h3>\n<p>While Volvo\u2019s infotainment is being powered by Qualcomm\u2019s SoC, its new automated driving (AD) features will be powered by Nvidia\u2019s. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/04\/tusimple-integrates-nvidias-newest-auto-grade-chip-to-scale-autonomous-trucking\/\">Autonomous trucking startup TuSimple also said at CES 2022<\/a> that it would use Drive Orin to power and scale its self-driving tech.<\/p>\n<p>Nvidia\u2019s chip is a central computer for intelligent vehicles that\u2019s made specifically for autonomous applications. It delivers 254 trillion operations per seconds and provides the sort of auto-grade compute power needed to handle self-driving functions.<\/p>\n<p>JiDU Auto, Baidu&#8217;s electric vehicle company, also announced it will use the Nvidia Drive Orin SoC. This next-generation vehicle with Level 4 autonomous driving capability will make its debut at the Beijing Auto Show in April, followed by mass production and delivery by 2023.<\/p>\n<p>Other companies using Drive Orin include\u00a0Polestar, IM Motors, Li Auto, NIO, R Auto and Xpeng.<\/p>\n<h3>Intel-Mobileye<\/h3>\n<p>Intel subsidiary Mobileye announced plans to bring a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/04\/intels-mobileye-autonomous-driving-chip-for-consumer-vehicles\/\">new supercomputer<\/a> to market designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.<\/p>\n<p>The company introduced at the 2022 CES tech trade show a new system on chip called EyeQ Ultra that is purpose-built for autonomous driving. The company said the first silicon for the EyeQ Ultra SoC, which is capable of 176 trillion operations per second (TOPS), is expected at the end of 2023 with full automotive grade production in 2025.<\/p>\n<p>The company also introduced at CES its next-generation EyeQ SoC for advanced driver-assistance systems called EyeQ6L and EyeQ6H.<\/p>\n<h2>Connected everything<\/h2>\n<p>What do you get when you combine the internet with insane processing power in a vehicle? A sci-fi world of incredible, and some might say unnecessary, tech that lets car owners sync their digital and physical worlds.<\/p>\n<p>Want to program your car to order you a pizza as you leave the office so it\u2019s hot and ready when you get home? It can be done. Feel like hearing the stats on your battery\u2019s power and vehicle range? Speak and it shall be delivered. Want to put your feet up and watch the latest episode of \u201cThe Wheel of Time\u201d? There\u2019s tech for that, too.<\/p>\n<p>The in-vehicle tech displayed at CES drilled home the idea of the car as a connected device that is meant to make your life easier, smoother and more entertaining.<\/p>\n<h3>Google<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2253607\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2253607\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2253607\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png\" alt=\"Google Home device voice assist to heat up volvo car\" width=\"1024\" height=\"584\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png 2644w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=150,86 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=300,171 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=768,438 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=680,388 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=1536,876 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=2048,1168 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2253607\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Volvo Cars<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Many cars today run their infotainment systems off of Android\u2019s auto operating system, making it easier to access your phone and compatible apps on your phone from your car.

At CES 2022, Stellantis <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/05\/stellantis-draft\/\">announced a wide-ranging collaboration<\/a> that will touch nearly every aspect of its business. Amazon&#8217;s technology will be used to help Stellantis develop vehicles, build connected in-vehicle experiences and train the next generation of automotive software engineers.<\/p>\n<p>As part of this multiyear deal, Stellantis has selected Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms. Stellantis, which recently launched a software academy for existing and new employees, is also working with AWS to create a curriculum that will cover software, data and cloud technology.<\/p>\n<h3>Cerence<\/h3>\n<p>Software company Cerence unveiled its Cerence Co-Pilot, an in-car assistant that uses continuous learning to anticipate the needs of drivers and proactively initiate actions. The co-pilot is integrated with the car\u2019s sensors and data to understand the environment inside the vehicle and around it, analyzing things like voice, gaze, gesture and touch to understand user preferences and perform actions on the driver\u2019s behalf.<\/p>\n<p>Cerence\u2019s co-pilot can do things like control smart home and IoT devices, authorize payments for in-car purchases and remind drivers about car maintenance needs, even scheduling a trip to the shop for them.<\/p>\n<p>At CES, Cerence announced a partnership to introduce this tech to Vietnamese automaker Vinfast&#8217;s cars (more on that below). No other integrations were shared, but a <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/657534151\/4e8916fe3b\">video<\/a> demonstrating the tech showed such brands as Volvo, BMW, Audi and Mercedes, some of which have worked with Cerence in the past.<\/p>\n<h3>Blackberry<\/h3>\n<p>Blackberry announced a partnership with Pateo, an internet-of-vehicles service and product provider in China, that will see Blackberry Ivy, the company\u2019s intelligent vehicle data platform co-developed with Amazon Web Services, integrated into Pateo\u2019s digital cockpit solution. The two companies are to work with an unnamed Chinese automaker to pilot the cockpit on its electric model lineup.<\/p>\n<p>The software company most renowned for its mobile phones didn\u2019t share much about what that cockpit would look like, but it should encompass such features as intelligent voice, entertainment, vehicle health monitoring, secure payment and cloud technology. Blackberry and Pateo will also incorporate Electra Vehicles\u2019s EVE-Ai 360 Adaptive Controls that provides prediction of battery state of charge, state of health and project vehicle range.<\/p>\n<h2>ADAS\/AD<\/h2>\n<p>In past years, autonomous driving took center stage. This year, the focus was more on advanced driver-assistance systems and promises to bring restricted automated driving features to passenger vehicles. Due to the advancements in vehicle sensors, compute power and software, automakers are working to automate certain aspects of the car, like parking or highway driving.<\/p>\n<p>That doesn\u2019t mean some companies pursuing so-called Level 4 autonomous driving didn\u2019t show up at CES; they just weren\u2019t the ones yelling the loudest this year.<\/p>\n<h3>GM\u2019s Ultra Cruise<\/h3>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, GM\u2019s new Ultra Cruise hands-free ADAS system will be powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon SoC. GM introduced the Ultra Cruise system in 2021, but this was the first time we heard more details about the compute and some of the capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>The system is an upgrade from the automaker\u2019s Super Cruise ADAS first introduced in 2017, and it\u2019s expected to be able to handle 95% of all driving scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>Ultra Cruise, which is coming to the new electric Cadillac Celestiq in 2023, will rely on sensors like cameras, radar and lidar (not just lidar map data) to feed data to GM\u2019s software that will then output decisions.<\/p>\n<h3>Volvo\u2019s Ride Pilot<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2253530\" style=\"width: 953px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2253530\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2253530\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png\" alt=\"Volvo Cars Concept Recharge showing autonomous vehicle using lidar\" width=\"943\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png 943w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png?resize=150,58 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png?resize=300,115 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png?resize=768,296 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png?resize=680,262 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/292920_Volvo_Cars_Concept_Recharge_safety_illustration.png?resize=50,19 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2253530\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Volvo Cars<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Volvo shared plans to work with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/05\/volvo-partners-with-luminar-and-zenseact-to-bring-autonomous-driving-feature-to-new-e-suv\/\">lidar company Luminar<\/a> and AD software company Zenseact to introduce Ride Pilot as an add-on subscription to an electric SUV that will be revealed later this year. Ride Pilot is an \u201cunsupervised\u201d AD feature, meaning it can drive itself fully while drivers are on certain highways, giving them the ability to go completely hands and eyes free so they can enjoy other activities, like the YouTube watching we mentioned earlier.<\/p>\n<h3>JiDU<\/h3>\n<p>Chinese internet giant Baidu\u2019s EV startup JiDU came to CES 2022 with news that it would power its first production EV model, which is expected to begin deliveries in 2023, on Nvidia\u2019s Drive Orin SoC (as mentioned above). The company said it would have Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, all of which would be revealed in April at the Beijing Auto Show.<\/p>\n<p>JiDu is just a year old and recently demonstrated intelligent assisted driving in both urban and high-speed areas in its SIMUCar.<\/p>\n<h3>Cadillac<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2254175\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2254175\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2254175\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg\" alt=\"Cadillac autonomous lounge concept innerspace\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2254175\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Cadillac<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>While not entirely focused on autonomous driving capabilities or ADAS features, it\u2019s worth noting how <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/05\/cadillacs-new-self-driving-concept-is-a-luxury-loveseat-on-wheels\/\">Cadillac envisions the inside of its future autonomous vehicles<\/a>. Its InnerSpace concept shows your standard spaceship-looking two-seater car from the outside, while inside it still looks like a spaceship. But like a sexy spaceship.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than separate driver and passenger seats, there\u2019s a plush and sleek loveseat that appears to constantly be in recline mode, which checks out given the built-in ottoman and compartment for slippers and a blanket. A mere couple of feet in front of the passengers\u2019 heads is a wide, curved screen. No steering wheels or pedals are featured.<\/p>\n<h3>Indy Autonomous Challenge<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/racer1.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout alignnone wp-image-2255223 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/racer1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"422\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Last October, teams from around the world converged on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to demonstrate autonomous racing.<\/p>\n<p>The teams gathered again, this time at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway on January 7 with the Autonomous Challenge @ CES. IAC university teams developed the software that runs the autonomous racecar, the Dallara AV-21.<\/p>\n<p>Leading up to the event, the organization published a few videos, including this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uVF_JVhOrU4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">one that was filmed at night<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Gentex<\/h3>\n<p>Gentex, which supplies automotive and aerospace sectors, showed off the results of two acquisitions in 2021: Israel-based Guardian Optical Technologies and Vaposens.<\/p>\n<p>The company showed a lot, but its ultra-sensitive driver monitoring system that is designed to be used to support driver-assistance systems got our attention. Guardian Optical Technologies developed an infrared-sensitive, high-resolution camera combining machine vision, depth perception and micro-vibration detection. What this means is its proprietary sensor configuration can monitor the entire vehicle cabin and all its objects and occupants, assessing their behavior, gestures and activities.<\/p>\n<h2>NFTs, color changing cars and other fun stuff<\/h2>\n<h3>Vinfast<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2255174\" style=\"width: 1610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/S9.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2255174\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2255174 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/S9.jpg\" alt=\"Vinfast CES 2022 electric vehicles\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/S9.jpg 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/S9.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/S9.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/S9.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/S9.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/S9.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/S9.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2255174\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Vinfast<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In addition to revealing three new EVs at CES this year, Vietnamese EV company Vinfast announced the formation of its early-bird reservation site. The first to preorder will receive a \u201cVinFirst\u201d certificate on the blockchain platform in NFT form, which the company says is a completely transparent way to prove ownership of an order number.<\/p>\n<p>The term &#8220;digital twin&#8221; popped up a few times in the automotive sector at CES 2022, including an announcement from Cerence and Vinfast. The gist is this: Cerence has cloud-based software that allows Vinfast (or any other company intrigued by the product) to create a virtual representation of its entire car, including software, mechanics, electrics and physical behavior, along with driver data and environmental data.<\/p>\n<h3>Indi EV<\/h3>\n<p>Indi EV, a California-based EV startup, came out with a prototype of its Indi One at CES, which the company says is \u201cthe world\u2019s first social media-oriented car.\u201d What that seems to mean is a car that has an integrated computer for gaming, a complete Windows workstation that can handle Zoom calls and even record events that can later be shared on social media and software that lets riders capture trip content and video to be uploaded to the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>If all that wasn\u2019t enough, the Indi One is meant to enable a type of mobile blockchain, wherein each vehicle can act as a node for a blockchain. Exactly why that\u2019s significant is unclear, but You Do You, Indi EV. Customers can start preordering by the end of Q1, and the car is expected to go for around $45,000.<\/p>\n<h3>BMW<\/h3>\n<p>BMW <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/01\/05\/bmw-shows-off-a-color-changing-car\/\">unwrapped its color-changing car at CES, the BMW iX Flow<\/a>.

But a handful of gadgets this year are taking care to treat dogs and cats not just as beloved furry friends but as intelligent animals with their own processes, emotions and even a desire to express themselves.<\/p>\n<p>At the most basic level \u2014 which is to say, pretty advanced compared with a few years ago \u2014 we have <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/rabo.cat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Catlog<\/a><\/strong>, a smart cat collar and weight-sensing platform that helps owners keep track of their feline&#8217;s daily movements.<\/p>\n<p>The collar senses movement and vibrations, which it correlates with &#8220;cat-like behavior&#8221; like sleeping, sitting there, washing its paws, eating and drinking \u2014 even moving around, which some cats have been known to do. All these actions (including hairballs) gets sent to you through an IoT hub nearly live. And you can look back over your cat&#8217;s day to see when and how often they&#8217;ve played, slept and so on.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2253251\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>This basic aspect of illuminating a pet&#8217;s daily life when you&#8217;re not around is a good first step to understanding that they are more than a lap accessory \u2014 they exist and do things even when you&#8217;re not looking.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Ksne8tpBsvE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Invoxia<\/strong> takes things a little further with its smart collar that tracks your dog&#8217;s location but also its heart and respiratory condition. Now, I can&#8217;t vouch for the efficacy of this, but given the advances we&#8217;ve made in smart watches and other devices that can detect adverse events or conditions in humans, it doesn&#8217;t seem implausible at all that something similar could be whipped up for dogs.<\/p>\n<p>Animals have heart and lung issues just like any other animal with those organs, and sadly some breeds are predisposed to them as well. Sure, you can take them to the vet twice a year so she can listen to the dog&#8217;s breathing, but why not also have a collar that alerts you if something seems off? Just like with ourselves, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2253370\" style=\"width: 982px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/inupathy.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2253370\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2253370\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/inupathy.jpg\" alt=\"Three different size dogs wear Inupathy heart rate detecting backpacks.\" width=\"972\" height=\"562\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/inupathy.jpg 972w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/inupathy.jpg?resize=150,87 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/inupathy.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/inupathy.jpg?resize=768,444 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/inupathy.jpg?resize=680,393 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/inupathy.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2253370\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Inupathy<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Beyond just detecting physiological signs we find <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.inupathy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inupathy<\/a><\/strong>, a dog-worn backpack that the company claims can detect a variety of psychological conditions as well. Now, let us not give too much credit here, as human-focused devices along these lines have had very mixed results as well. But Langualess, which makes the backpack, <a href=\"https:\/\/langualess.com\/#tech\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explains their work as follows<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>An animal&#8217;s heart normally beats at a gentle rhythm, but accelerates when the animal starts feeling nervous. This change in the rhythm is triggered by the sympathetic nervous activity. Through our independent research, we have found that it is possible to estimate the dogs\u2019 mental state in more detail by analysing the heart rate variability in depth.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Heart rate analysis is of course a field with a long and rich history, and one with as many hits as misses. But it is not unreasonable to think that you can tell whether a dog is relaxed, temporarily excited, or entering a prolonged angry or anxious state. The company&#8217;s main tech advance has been to create a local sensor and circuit that reliably detects and characterizes the animal&#8217;s heart rate.<\/p>\n<p>There are of course more external tells, like tail position, stance and vocalizations, but not every dog is so emotive and anyway, why not add a little more data to the mix?<\/p>\n<p>A propos additional data, Taiwan&#8217;s largest applied research institution ITRI showed off its neat <strong>iPetWeaR<\/strong> concept, which goes deep on data-driven early warning signals for doggie heart attack prevention. The low-power physiological detection radar technology is harmless &#8211; it does not require skin contact with the pet &#8211; and can be attached to a pet&#8217;s collar or stuffed into a doggie bed for flexible sensing.<\/p>\n<p>The basic US$80 product package includes a sensor device, a collar selected from various options, and a mobile app &#8211; and works for both cats and dogs.\u00a0The company put together an adorable demo video, which of course an excellent reason for us to include it in our roundup:<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/GUHGec_9sCI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The physiological data collected by the iPetWear is scooped up and beamed to the pet owner&#8217;s phone by Bluetooth. In the case of irregular heartbeat or breathing, a notification is sent so the owner can intervene &#8211; and the product promises early detection of a pet\u2019s underlying health condition.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wagz.com\/\"><strong>Wagz<\/strong><\/a> has been around for a hot minute, and its Freedom Collar introduced virtual geofences so you can ensure your four-legged friends stays put. With GPS tracking, fitness mapping and &#8216;humane&#8217; corrections (as opposed to a shock collar), the collar has become a popular solution for training pups. New for CES 2022, though, is the addition of Wagz Tagz. The idea is letting the dog roam free around the house, but creating small zones where the pup isn&#8217;t allowed.

(Let&#8217;s be honest \u2014 all dogs are good, but not all of them can reliably form sentences.)<\/p>\n<p>The various kits contain self-contained and labeled buttons that, when pressed, produce a word like &#8220;outside,&#8221; &#8220;food&#8221; or of course &#8220;love you.&#8221; These stick into larger, easily identifiable foam mats (hopefully they don&#8217;t taste good) to aid learning by sight.<\/p>\n<p>Does the dog really know what it means when it says &#8220;love you&#8221;? Perhaps, perhaps not \u2014 the love is not in doubt, but it may understand that when it presses that one, it gets pets. Likewise, the food button tends to speed up dinner. And pressing &#8220;outside&#8221; works faster than staring wistfully at the door. You may not be carrying on full conversations with the dog, but it could be a fun way to change up the way your best friend expresses themselves \u2014 because they certainly do that, and sometimes in regrettable ways.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/ces-2022\/?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=footer-banner\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/ces-2022-banner.jpg\" alt=\"Read more about CES 2022 on TechCrunch\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There&#8217;s always fun tech for pet owners at CES, and 2022 is no different.
