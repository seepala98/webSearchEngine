Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in late February, Delfast\u2019s top priority has been to see its Ukrainian team of 30 safely evacuated from the most dangerous parts of the country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n When not focusing on sales, marketing, R&D and customer support, Delfast\u2019s smaller team of seven employees based in Los Angeles has been pleading with U.S. politicians and the European Commission to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and fighter jets that could help Ukraine gain back some control over its air space, and, hopefully, put a stop to this war.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Delfast\u2019s co-founders, Daniel Tonkopi and Serhiy Denysenko, say they have always believed in safeguarding the future. When they founded Delfast in 2014, originally as a delivery company, Tonkoply and Denysenko knew that providing couriers with green transportation options would be critical to the company\u2019s operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n \t \n\t\t \n\t\t\tThe most important thing for an entrepreneur, and in general for any leader, is to protect the team and be completely honest with them during a tough time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Tonkopi, co-founder of Delfast<\/cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/span><\/p>\n The founders soon realized that a bike with the power, range and battery life their couriers needed didn\u2019t exist, and so they set out to build one. In 2017, backed by a Kickstarter campaign that saw the company raise $165,000, the startup began manufacturing a bike to fit its needs \u2013 one that promptly <\/span>won the Guinness Book of World Records<\/span><\/a> for the greatest distance traveled on an electric motorbike on a single charge.<\/span><\/p>\n More recently, the Delfast Top 3.0 e-motorbike <\/span>won Forbes\u2019 fastest e-bike of the year<\/span><\/a> in 2022 after the company announced some serious <\/span>upgrades to the vehicle during CES<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n We spoke with Delfast\u2019s co-founders to discuss what it\u2019s like running a startup during a war, how the startup is considering breaking into new business verticals, and the importance of always having a Plan B.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n Note: Serhiy Denysenko\u2019s answers were translated from Ukrainian by a member of Delfast\u2019s team for TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n TC: Serhiy, you’re on the ground in Kyiv. What’s your day-to-day like?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues. It\u2019s important to keep in touch and know that everyone is fine, or as fine as is possible right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Besides my work as a COO, I\u2019ve been helping with volunteering, getting supplies and medicine to people, and this is something that pretty much every Ukrainian is now doing. I had my family relocated to Hungary, so I feel more or less safe, and I\u2019m just trying to work as much as possible and do my best in every possible area, whether that\u2019s supporting the company or supporting Ukraine in general.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n How are you managing your team through this crisis? What\u2019s changed?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>We got used to working remotely during Coronavirus times, so we have our task tracker, where everyone can see his or her task. Every Monday, we have an online Zoom meeting. Previously we only had these meetings at the executive level, but now during the war, we are gathering all together, just to see each other\u2019s faces and ask how they\u2019re doing, how\u2019s everyone feeling. Just to talk with everybody.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n <\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":" “Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues.

But second, and more immediately relevant in this case, you would not know that there is a technique to it that, surprisingly, robots aren’t super good at because they tend to be… crushy. But this robo-berry<\/a> designed by Swiss researchers could usher in a new era of gentle, automated robo-pickers.<\/p>\n The secret to picking a raspberry is to grip it just enough to get purchase and then pull it downwards off the little stem, apparently called the “receptacle,” which seems backwards. Seems simple \u2014 and it is, but only our hands are among the most sensitive and finely controlled constructions in the universe, the culmination of a hundred million years of evolution, outdone only by (I suspect) raccoons.<\/p>\n Robots simply don’t have the senses necessary to figure out the perfect technique for picking a berry. But what if it could communicate with the berry to better sense the forces involved and avoid either a a brutal crushing or humiliating failure-to-detach?<\/p> <\/div>\n That’s what Kai Junge, a PhD student at EPFL in Switzerland, aims to accomplish with this “sensorized raspberry,” a silicone and silicon replica berry that provides feedback to the picking machine, allowing it to learn to pick faster and better \u2014 and cleaner.<\/p>\n “It\u2019s an exciting dilemma for us as robotics engineers,” said professor Josie Hughes, who worked with Junge on the project. “The raspberry harvesting season is so short, and the fruit is so valuable, that wasting them simply isn’t an option. What’s more, the cost and logistical challenges of testing different options out in the field are prohibitive. That\u2019s why we decided to run our tests in the lab and develop a replica raspberry for training harvesting robots.”<\/p>\n Apparently the hard part comes just at the moment of detaching, when the force needed to grip the berry on the receptacle suddenly becomes overkill as the object goes from solid to hollow.<\/p>\n The replica berry has a fluidic sensor that tells the system how much compression is being experienced by the silicone drooplets, allowing the control model to learn how to adjust its grip as if the berry itself is telling it how much is too much.<\/p>\n You can see the berry in action below:<\/p>\n <\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The team plans to present their work at RobotSoft in April. And once the raspberry question is decided, they may move on to other berries, tomatoes, grapes&#8230; even apricots.

Now, the company offers inter-city rides, car ride-sharing, and corporate services in the 10 cities it operates in across Africa and the Middle East.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The partnership between Swvl and Queen\u2019s Gambit came from a mutual interest from both parties<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While searching for a company to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acquire<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl fit the blank-check company\u2019s criteria: strong business fundamentals, mobility and logistics (one of its core verticals), and an ESG ethos around women and affordable transportation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl &#8212; off the back of raising over $170 million in venture capital, expanding to over 16 countries across Latin America, Asia and Africa; hiring executives from Facebook, Uber and Optimus; and acquiring Shotl, Viapool and door2door &#8212; was on a quest for global dominance in the mobility space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A SPAC with Queen\u2019s Gambit was the most suitable option for it from a financial standpoint, and both parties feel strongly about the sustainability angle around transport &#8212; Swvl claims it has prevented approximately 289 million pounds of carbon emissions since its inception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company plans to expand into several countries over the next six months, including Colombia, Mexico, South Africa, and the U.S. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, all eyes will be on the company\u2019s performance as it <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">officially<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starts trading tomorrow in a cooling SPAC market and a generally unsettled public market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s a softness in the market, but as long as the company operates and delivers results, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maybe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today, people don\u2019t pay attention to it, but they will in months ahead,\u201d Grace said about the worrying SPAC and public markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the market will change <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like it always does and people go back to fundamentals at how we look at company\u2019s performances.

But with Minit, the tech giant is doubling down on a software category that could be worth over $11 billion by 2030, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wfmz.com\/news\/pr_newswire\/pr_newswire_technology\/global-process-mining-software-market-size-value-estimated-to-reach-usd-11-096-7-million\/article_a95b3354-ec2f-5389-b761-e4dbbdadbb97.html#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20report%20published,forecast%20period%202022%20to%202030.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according<\/a> to a report from Polaris Market Research.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292372\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear whether the whole of the Minit team will join Microsoft &#8212; or, indeed, whether the company will remain spread across its current locations. (Minit is now headquartered in Amsterdam, with satellite offices in London and New York.) But CEO James Dening said that customers shouldn&#8217;t expect a change in the level of support they&#8217;re currently receiving.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to what it means to become part of an industry leader like Microsoft and what that brings us &#8212; how we can use that scale and excellence to continue to deliver great solutions to our customers,&#8221; Dening wrote in a blog <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minit.io\/blog\/microsoft-minit-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post<\/a> on Minit&#8217;s website. &#8220;It has been a privilege to lead the company for the last year, and I\u2019m excited to continue my journey with the team, as part of what I consider to be the world\u2019s leading software company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Microsoft spokesperson Zara Huang told TechCrunch that the Minit team will move into the\u00a0<span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> Process Insights team and that there will be &#8220;no change&#8221; to the current work location of Minit team members. <span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> is in early stages of determining how Minit will be integrated into its offerings, she said, and the companies will share more details when they&#8217;re available.<\/p>\n<p>Minit, which was founded in 2015 by Rasto Hlavac and had raised \u20ac10.3 million (~$11.40 million) prior to the acquisition, is one of an expanding number of startups developing process mining tools aimed at enterprise clientele. Process mining, also known as task discovery, involves spotting root cause workflow issues and bottlenecks by pulling data from systems including desktop, email apps and workflows. It&#8217;s a key part of robotic process automation (RPA), a technology that promises to automate monotonous, repetitive tasks traditionally performed by human workers while at the same time generating logs to identify potential cost savings.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As Protocol&#8217;s Aisha Counts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/bulletins\/microsoft-process-mining-minit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notes<\/a>, process mining has traditionally been done by system integrators who map out processes by analyzing manual workflows. Process mining software is designed to digitize the approach in a way that reduces the expense, time and effort involved.<\/p>\n<p>Underlining the appetite for process mining technologies, Celonis, a data processing company, earlier this week acquired Minit competitor Process Analytics Factory, which coincidentally integrates with Microsoft&#8217;s Power BI analytics platform. Just in the past several years, RPA vendor Automation Anywhere acquired process discovery and mining startups FortressIQ, Process Gold\\ and StepShot; Blue Prism released a task mining solution called Capture; and rivals including ABBYY and Kryon have expanded their process mining offerings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/\">Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=wqSRCOP7wQ#?secret=2NKiKfcj0k\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;You know the process space is hot when even Microsoft, with its vast resources, has to buy its way in.

SAP acquired German process automation company Signavio in January 2021, just before ServiceNow got into the RPA segment with the buyout of India-based Intellibot.io.

been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robotics-roundup-12\/\">focused on pizza<\/a>. I\u2019ve long posited that this is for two key reasons. First: People like pizza. We eat a lot of it. Americans alone eat three billion pizzas a year. Second: It\u2019s relatively easy to make. The dough provides a fairly straightforward platform onto which ingredients are added.<\/p>\n<p>I say \u201cfairly\u201d here because there are still complications. There\u2019s really no such thing as easy when it comes to building robots that can execute variations on a task at a large scale. Here it\u2019s the dough that presents the problem. Turning a soft and malleable ball of dough into a pizza crust is one of those things humans have figured out how to do efficiently, but it still proves difficult for robot workers.<\/p>\n<p>A team of researchers at MIT, CMU and UC San Diego set out to create what they\u2019ve deemed \u201ccomplex dough-manipulation.\u201d The system is separated into a two-step process, in which the robot must first determine the task and then execute it using a tool like a rolling pin. The system, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2022\/robotic-deformable-object-0331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DiffSkill<\/a>, involves teaching robots complex tasks in simulations.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292473\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>MIT notes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A \u201cteacher\u201d algorithm solves each step the robot must take to complete the task. Then, it trains a \u201cstudent\u201d machine-learning model that learns abstract ideas about when and how to execute each skill it needs during the task, like using a rolling pin. With this knowledge, the system reasons about how to execute the skills to complete the entire task.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The researchers say the system outperformed those trained in the more traditional reinforcement learning model. \u201cOur framework provides a novel way for robots to acquire new skills. These skills can then be chained to solve more complex tasks which are beyond the capability of previous robot systems,\u201d says CSAIL grad student, Yunzhu Li.<\/p>\n<p>This is robotics, so the whole pizza thing is really an initial problem for a system designed to tackle a lot more tasks. The company points to the emerging field of eldercare robotics as a possible use going forward.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A disproportionate number of the early industrial food-making robots we\u2019ve seen have been focused on pizza.

facial recognition startup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kairos.com\/\">Kairos<\/a>, has made his way back to the company following his ouster in 2018. Brackeen is now chairing the company&#8217;s scientific advisory board, where he&#8217;ll help to address and eliminate issues of racial bias from the technology.<\/p>\n<p>While that\u2019s not the company\u2019s explicit mission \u2014 it\u2019s to provide authentication tools to businesses \u2014 algorithmic bias has long been a topic the company, especially Brackeen, has addressed.<\/p>\n<p>But what happened in the time leading up to his ouster and the events that followed was quite the whirlwind.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2127134\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>In 2018, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/27\/facial-recognition-startup-kairos-founder-continues-to-fight-attempted-takeover\/\">Kairos&#8217; board of directors forced Brackeen out of his role as CEO, citing willful misconduct as the cause for his termination<\/a>. In addition to forcing him out of the company he founded, Kairos sued Brackeen, alleging the misappropriation of corporate funds and misleading shareholders.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/27\/facial-recognition-startup-kairos-founder-continues-to-fight-attempted-takeover\/\">At the time<\/a>, Brackeen referred to the events as &#8220;a poorly structured coup,&#8221; and denied the allegations. Then, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/16\/kairos-founder-countersues-for-10-million\/\">Brackeen countersued<\/a> Kairos, alleging the company and its CEO Melissa Doval intentionally destroyed his reputation through fraudulent conduct. In 2019, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/31\/facial-recognition-startup-kairos-settles-lawsuits-with-founder-and-former-ceo-brian-brackeen\/\">Brackeen and Kairos settled the lawsuits.<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/31\/facial-recognition-startup-kairos-settles-lawsuits-with-founder-and-former-ceo-brian-brackeen\/\">Brackeen then went on to start Lightship Capital with his wife, Candice Brackeen<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Since returning to Kairos, Brackeen has already directed Kairos to focus on what it&#8217;s calling the Bias API. The API is designed to make it easier for companies and firms to detect and address any algorithmic biases, according to Brackeen.<\/p>\n<p>Brackeen is not back on a full-time basis, as he has his hands pretty full with Lightship Capital, but he said he&#8217;s generally tasked with steering the ship during quarterly meetings.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ckUNckx3h2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/27\/facial-recognition-startup-kairos-founder-continues-to-fight-attempted-takeover\/\">Facial recognition startup Kairos founder continues to fight attempted takeover<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Facial recognition startup Kairos founder continues to fight attempted takeover&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/27\/facial-recognition-startup-kairos-founder-continues-to-fight-attempted-takeover\/embed\/#?secret=ckUNckx3h2\" data-secret=\"ckUNckx3h2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Despite the drama of the past, Brackeen told TechCrunch he still considers Kairos to be his baby. It&#8217;s also worth noting that folks like Doval, who was appointed to CEO following Brackeen&#8217;s ouster, and Mary Wolff, the former COO who spearheaded the lawsuit, are gone.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;First, I will always feel a responsibility to the team, investors and fans of Kairos,&#8221; Brackeen said as to why he&#8217;s returned. &#8220;Many of whom I was singularly responsible for. Secondly, as a society, bias can be found in everything from Twitter image cropping to air dryers not turning on for Black hands. It\u2019s a painful reminder of a society that\u2019s not fair for all. The challenge is that as AI gets to be imbedded in more and more products, we will see bias in all kinds of products. Kairos with its large data set and years of IP, must be the firm that saves us from that dystopian future. I am uniquely situated to lead that strategy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em>An earlier version of this post said Stephen Moore is the CEO of Kairos.

GitHub did not disclose the name of the person who resigned, but it\u2019s widely known that Carrie Olesen was the chief human resources officer at GitHub.

I appreciate that they have denounced white supremacy and the dangers it poses to everybody.<\/p>\n<p>We all saw on January 6 that the greatest threat to the USA is not Islam, Black Lives, or defunding police.<\/p>\n<p>White supremacy has us all held hostage using feigned civility, bad-faith arguments\/negotiations, and amtssprache*, and it does not stop until we are all dead or subjugated. I am glad that the nazi coup was a failure, and we avoided a successful Reichstag fire. That said, nazis do not give up easily.<\/p>\n<p>Keep your families and communities safe. Connect with your neighbors and local stores. Fascism and nazism succeed when we are divided. They demand that you abandon reason, that you acquiesce to power and hierarchy, and that you shun altruism. Love yourself. Support, join or create local unions. Build community. Don\u2019t entertain nazis.<\/p>\n<p>I appreciate those who have supported me and my family.

With the help of social currency startup <a href=\"https:\/\/tryroll.com\/\">Roll<\/a>, Crews is launching his own social currency, $POWER.<\/p>\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s break down what that means. Anyone can create a social currency, which hundreds of creators have already done via Roll, to change their relationships with fans and users. Roll enables creators to mint and distribute their own social currency under the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/news\/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum\/\">ERC-20 standard<\/a> and then determine the ways in which their communities can earn and spend that social currency.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Anyone, anywhere, anytime can create their own content,&#8221; Roll founder and CEO Bradley Miles told TechCrunch. &#8220;We refer to this as mass personalization of content. Right now, Roll is experiencing the same thing with money itself. Anyone, anywhere, anytime can create their own money.&#8221;<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2123673\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>The way I think of it is it&#8217;s almost like the process for earning and redeeming credit card points but minus the credit card company and plus the blockchain and creators. I haven&#8217;t run this analogy by Miles, but I&#8217;m going with it. Just how your credit card provider gives you points for using your card and then you can redeem those points for cash, airline tickets, etc., creators give fans social currency for engaging with their work in a variety of ways. Then, fans can redeem that social currency for more art, content or what have you.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, there are about 300 creators, including Crews, using Roll. Roll, which has <a href=\"https:\/\/tryroll.com\/roll-fundraise-mainstream\/\">$2.7 million in funding from investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Trevor McFedries and others,<\/a>\u00a0recently saw its <a href=\"https:\/\/app.tryroll.com\/markets\">social currency market cap surpass $1 billion<\/a>. Bradley Miles gifted me .10 $WHALE (worth about $3) so I could get a better understanding of how creators are already using Roll. $WHALE is backed by tangible and rare non-fungible token assets, which means that I can use my $WHALE to buy <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/explosive-inclusive-potential-nfts\/\">NFTs<\/a>. Because Roll enables users to trade their social currency for over 600 other digital assets, that means I could buy the below NFT over on NFT marketplace OpenSea.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2123747\" style=\"width: 1132px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2123747\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2123747 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1122\" height=\"616\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png 1122w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=300,165 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=768,422 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=680,373 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-10.47.13-AM.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1122px) 100vw, 1122px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2123747\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits: <a href=\"https:\/\/opensea.io\/assets\/0x9e1f3e8db4d1119894624632499eaed1e56d2b1d\/268\">Screenshot\/OpenSea<\/a><\/strong><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>However, you&#8217;ll see that the Podmork Pix 35 WS cost 28 $WHALE, so I will not be buying this NFT.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Crews, he envisions folks earning $POWER via blockchain art purchases, NFTs, physical goods and experiences. Initially, Crews is engaging with his $POWER community through Discord. Folks with 50 $POWER, for example, can access a special channel within Discord. To date, Crews had distributed $POWER to about 100 people, he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If I give you $POWER, you own a piece of me,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no other way to put it. And I want to be very careful about who is holding me, no puns intended.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s still early days for $POWER, but Crews says he eventually wants to offer interest-free microloans to artists. The ultimate goal with $POWER is to empower artists.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our long-term plan,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;To become this thing that this community can live and exist in. You could use it anywhere you are &#8212; at Target, the grocery store.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Crews attributes his interest in this space to something that happened to him about four years ago.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"9qH20Dn1ns\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services\/\">DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;DeFi aims to bridge the gap between blockchains and financial services&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/defi-aims-to-bridge-the-gap-between-blockchains-and-financial-services\/embed\/#?secret=9qH20Dn1ns\" data-secret=\"9qH20Dn1ns\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>While in Milan, Crews said he was trying to buy designer furniture from an artist he respected at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salonemilano.it\/en\/exhibitions\/international-furnishing-accessories-exhibition\">Salone del Mobile<\/a>. He realized he needed extra money to complete the purchase, but didn&#8217;t have enough cash in his checking account to cover it. So he got on the phone with American Express, he said, who told him to go to a local bank. American Express, on Crews&#8217; behalf, then tried to explain the situation to the local bank manager so that Crews could get the funds he needed to complete the transaction. <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Crews said the local bank manager took one look at him and said, &#8220;No.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m watching all these white men and women pass me in line, and they&#8217;re looking at me strangely,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;I&#8217;d been standing there for 15 minutes and it slowly dawns on me that because I&#8217;m Black, I was not going to get my money,&#8221; he said.\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">&#8220;That was the moment I knew everything had to change for me.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Crews ended up going to a check-cashing place, in an area where he said his Uber driver refused to go, and got the funds to pay the fees.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Bringing it up still makes me angry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What I love about this new world of finance is that cryptocurrency does not know what race you are, how old you are.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Through $POWER, Crews hopes to put power back in the hands of artists and creators, Crews explained.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no gatekeeper to tell us no,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Crews says he&#8217;s also going to start putting out his own content into the $POWER community, where the community will collectively own it together.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is bigger than me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a new future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For Miles, he envisions a world in which $POWER is accepted at movie theaters or at Paramount Pictures properties.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[Social currency] is not to replace the dollar,&#8221; Miles said. &#8220;It&#8217;s to complement [money] and do work that probably the dollar is not suited to do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I asked Crews if this means he&#8217;s leaving Hollywood and will solely focus on producing his own content for his $POWER community. But Crews said he left Hollywood when he sued William Morris Endeavor in 2017 alleging an executive from the firm groped him. Crews and WME <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/morning-mix\/wp\/2018\/09\/07\/actor-terry-crews-settles-his-lawsuit-against-the-powerful-hollywood-agent-who-allegedly-groped-him\/\">settled the suit in 2018<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And they were done with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the deal is, is that I had my power. I still had my talent. William Morris threatened to end everything I&#8217;m doing. But everything I&#8217;m doing right now, you can&#8217;t take. So that&#8217;s when I separated from Hollywood. I&#8217;ve never felt like a Hollywood person, even to this day. But every artist out there probably feels the same way. They want their power.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WcYCNy8Rez\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/explosive-inclusive-potential-nfts\/\">The explosive (and inclusive) potential of NFTs in the creative world<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The explosive (and inclusive) potential of NFTs in the creative world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/explosive-inclusive-potential-nfts\/embed\/#?secret=WcYCNy8Rez\" data-secret=\"WcYCNy8Rez\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Actor Terry Crews is going in on the blockchain.

But the industry still lacks true inclusion, despite best efforts put forth by heads of diversity, equity and inclusion at these companies.<\/p>\n<p>At TC Sessions: Justice, I spoke with Uber Chief Diversity Officer Bo Young Lee and Netflix VP of Inclusion Strategy for Product Wade Davis about the work that still needs to be done, the effects of California&#8217;s Proposition 22 and more.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>On last summer&#8217;s racial justice uprising<\/h3>\n<p>Last summer, after the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent collective consciousness around racial injustice in the U.S., many tech companies spoke out about racism and equality. Davis said he was happy to see more people speaking about those issues but also a bit frustrated that &#8220;it takes something like that for folks to get truly engaged.&#8221;<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2121359\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Davis: <\/strong>And inside of Netflix, one of the things that I was really intentional about is to tell our employees who are not Black, right, to not ask our employees how they feel but for them to be much more introspective of what it felt like for them, right, as a white person, or however they identify for them to do the introspection. Because that&#8217;s what it means to be an ally &#8212; to not put the labor on the group that is already feeling the impact and the oppression. And what we found was that many of our employees, for the first time had to wrestle with like, what it means to be white. What it means to be in a situation where you are seeing someone who looks like you take the life of someone who looks like me. So we really tried to switch the actual narrative and the conversation to not add more labor and trauma on our Black employees. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 1:10)<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Lee said she was a bit skeptical at the time because we&#8217;ve seen this type of response before in light of the violent killings of Black people.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: <\/strong>And then within a few weeks you see that interest and that focus wane once more. So I was skeptical that the enthusiasm would continue and enthusiasm in a way to try to solve all of our racism problems in a short period of time. I was surprised that it did continue. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 3:31)<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In her conversations with her counterparts at Uber, Lee said she wanted to make sure that the company didn&#8217;t make such a wide commitment that &#8220;those commitments became nothing more than virtue signaling at the end of the day.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: <\/strong>I said to my leadership, if you really want to come out and make some bold statements about being anti-racist, I&#8217;m going to create almost a litmus test to make sure that you really understand what that means because I don&#8217;t want to go up as a company to say we&#8217;re going to be anti-racist and then do nothing about it because that just relives and rehashes the injustices that we&#8217;ve seen in the past. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 4:25)<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So when Uber&#8217;s first post-anti-racism diversity report came out, and it showed Uber&#8217;s Black employee base declined, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/20\/despite-focus-on-anti-racism-ubers-black-employee-base-has-decreased\/\">Lee said at the time that was not acceptable<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: <\/strong>I think part of the commitments we made around being really anti-racist is transparency at all costs, even when we know that transparency could potentially make us look, not reflect as positively on us. So the question did go back, as you know, when we were putting together our diversity report is, &#8216;wow, these numbers are not where we want them to be. None of us are happy about it.&#8217; But in our commitment of being accountable, you know, we want the public to hold us accountable. We want to hold people accountable, we want to be accountable to our workforce, we&#8217;re going to be as transparent about why that decline in black employees happened and underrepresented people happened, what the cause was and what we are doing. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 6:11)<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/20\/despite-focus-on-anti-racism-ubers-black-employee-base-has-decreased\/\">Despite commitment to anti-racism, Uber\u2019s Black employee base has decreased<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:12801,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Open Sans&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:12}\">On being early in the DEI journey<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Netflix, despite having previously reported diversity numbers, only released its <a href=\"https:\/\/about.netflix.com\/en\/news\/netflix-inclusion-report-2021\">first official diversity report this year<\/a>. That&#8217;s partly because the team has only been in place for the last three years, Davis said.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Davis: <\/strong>So we&#8217;re still at the awareness building phase, like from a foundational standpoint, and we&#8217;re really trying to double down so that folks know why I&amp;D matters. Like, what it actually is, and how it impacts all of us. Because oftentimes, folks think of all of these isms and phobias as something that happens to other people. But if we can really make folks understand that there&#8217;s a cost to all these isms, and phobias to all of us individually, interpersonally, culturally and institutionally, then it makes it easier down the road when folks start to feel somewhat fatigued, right? Because there is always that fatigue factor. So we&#8217;re really trying to get ahead of that. And to have folks to think through like, what is in it for me, and what is in it for my colleagues. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 17:33)<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/17\/the-future-of-diversity-and-inclusion-in-tech\/\">The future of diversity and inclusion in tech<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Sharing the DEI load<\/h3>\n<p>Too often does the work of DEI fall on just a handful of people. At Netflix, Davis said it&#8217;s important that there is a shared load, and that all of its leaders are able to speak to the importance of diversity at the company.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Davis: <\/strong>And I would say our other largest goal is to make sure that all of our leaders can speak to the importance of AI and be more than just a talking point. So how do we build a model that&#8217;s a train the trainer model, where each of our leaders has a one to one inclusion coach, which requires them to have monthly sit-downs with their inclusion partner, where they go on a real intensive journey, so that they can understand how does their leadership style need to evolve and adapt and expand and flex to meet the needs of a larger set of individuals and not the historical ones who folks have engaged with? And we found that to put our leaders on the spot, so that when someone calls me to give a talk, I can say &#8216;No, our COO Greg Peters is just as competent and capable to sit on this panel about inclusion as I am.&#8217; And we feel that we&#8217;re modeling and signaling to our entire organization that this is not just a nice to have, but it&#8217;s part and parcel to your success as an employee, as a leader and to our success as an organization. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 18:26)<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"r0Cofc2V9s\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/30\/on-the-diversity-front-2020-may-prove-a-tipping-point\/\">On the diversity front, 2020 may prove a tipping point<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;On the diversity front, 2020 may prove a tipping point&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/30\/on-the-diversity-front-2020-may-prove-a-tipping-point\/embed\/#?secret=r0Cofc2V9s\" data-secret=\"r0Cofc2V9s\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>On Prop 22&#8217;s impact on people of color<\/h3>\n<p>Prop 22 went into effect in California earlier this year after a contentious battle where one side, including Uber, Lyft and other tech companies, wanted workers to remain independent contractors and the other side wanted gig workers to be made employees and therefore entitled to more benefits. Prop 22&#8217;s passage was a win for Uber and its counterparts, which collectively spent north of $200 million on its campaign efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Some have wondered how Uber can reconcile its commitment to anti-racism given that many gig workers are people of color. Lee, however, pushed back on that characterization.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Lee: <\/strong>I would challenge some of those that believe that Prop 22 actually disproportionately hurts people of color. If you actually look at the way the civil rights organizations that came out in support of Prop 22, the NAACP of Northern California and Hawaii came out in support of Prop 22, most of the Hispanic civil rights organizations as well. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 24:59)<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Prop 22, of course, was in response to the passage of AB 5, which set new standards of worker classification that were designed to make it harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Lee:\u00a0<\/strong>And you looked at the way those exceptions were being made to AB 5, you saw that the exceptions were disproportionately being made for those IC &#8212; you know, independent contractor roles that were predominantly represented by white workers. And they were all getting exceptions from AB 5. And then you look at the roles that were predominantly represented by people of color, especially underrepresented people of color, and those roles were not getting exceptions in AB 5. [&#8230;] For me, how I define racism isn&#8217;t based on intent but it&#8217;s based on impact. And when I see that kind of level of disparate, disproportionate impact, that&#8217;s when I think about, you know, what is racist or not. So I would challenge this notion that [Prop 22] actually disproportionately hurt people of color, especially given that we had civil rights organizations that said we support Prop 22. So, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything that really needs to be reconciled, from my perspective and from the organization&#8217;s perspective.\u00a0<em><strong>(Timestamp: 24:59)<\/strong><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/03\/ca-supreme-court-denies-lawsuit-challenging-prop-22s-constitutionality\/\">CA Supreme Court denies lawsuit challenging Prop 22\u2019s constitutionality<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/15\/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu\/\">Uber lobbies for \u2018Prop 22\u2019-style gig work standards in the EU<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/13\/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon\/\">An even bigger battle for gig worker rights is on the horizon<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:12801,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Open Sans&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:12}\"> <div embedded-video-placeholder=\"60400dc3303d501d18141bbc\" post-id=\"2120707\"><\/div> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/otter.ai\/u\/zN--5q60dfqViVw9Tfh4fJwG0as\">You can read the entire transcript here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/techcrunch-early-stage-is-the-startup-bootcamp-youve-always-needed\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">Early Stage<\/a> is the premier &#8220;how-to&#8221; event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

pandemic-ravaged economy. In California, a law went into effect earlier this year that makes gig workers independent contractors. Meanwhile, Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama are actively seeking to form a union to ensure better protections at the workplace.<\/p>\n<p>At TC Sessions: Justice, I spoke with Gig Workers Collective co-founder and organizer Vanessa Bain, The Congress of Essential Workers founder and former Amazon warehouse worker Christian Smalls and National Council for Occupational Safety and Health Co-Executive Director Jessica E. Martinez about what\u2019s next for gig workers and tech\u2019s contractor workforce, and what battles lie ahead for these essential workers.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>On the Amazon union drive<\/h3>\n<p>Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama are in the midst of a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/07\/amazon-warehouse-workers-begin-historic-vote-to-unionize\/\">historic union drive<\/a>. Smalls, who was fired from his job at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island last year after speaking out about the lack of personal protective equipment, told me he recently spent a few days in Bessemer.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2119188\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<blockquote><p>The building opened up when coronavirus started. When New York City became the epicenter, that&#8217;s when the Bessemer facility opened up. So the union got a head start on talking to workers. So that&#8217;s a gem for anybody or any union that plans on trying to unionize the building &#8212; that you have a facility in your community that&#8217;s about to open up, when opening, that&#8217;s the best time to connect with workers. That&#8217;s what happened last year. And as a result, the workers had seen what happened to the workers that were unprotected and they don&#8217;t want that. They want better for themselves. And they rightfully deserve that, especially in Alabama. It&#8217;s a right to work state, a state with no state minimum, obviously a red state. So I think it&#8217;s a lot of intangibles against them. But these workers now see the window of opportunity for change systemically. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 4:40)<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, President Biden recently came out in support of the unionizing efforts in Bessemer.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I would hope that he is a man of his word. He&#8217;s a pro-union guy. He ran his campaign off of that, saying he&#8217;s a union guy and unions need to be strong, and he supports unions all the way. It was powerful to see that the president, the man, the highest plateau in the country, supports the union. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 13:11)<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>[&#8230;] But once again, like Vanessa said, I don&#8217;t put all my eggs in that basket either. I just want to hold him accountable. Make sure that, you know, we see this all the way through to the end. Even if Alabama is not successful, if we were to try again, in other locations, other parts of the country, that we have the support of the highest power in the country, that is the most powerful thing that will resonate with workers. So it&#8217;s good to see that it&#8217;s happening now. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 14:17)<\/strong><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/07\/amazon-warehouse-workers-begin-historic-vote-to-unionize\/\">Amazon warehouse workers to begin historic vote to unionize<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/12\/amazon-faces-lawsuit-alleging-failure-to-provide-ppe-to-workers-during-pandemic\/\">Amazon faces lawsuit alleging failure to provide PPE to workers during pandemic<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/17\/amazon-ny-ag-lawsuit\/\">NY AG sues Amazon over treatment of warehouse workers<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>On the effects of Prop 22<\/h3>\n<p>Already, Prop 22 has affected industries outside of tech. In December, supermarket chain Albertsons began replacing delivery drivers with contractors and hundreds of employees in California were swapped for DoorDash workers, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/features\/2021-02-17\/gig-economy-coming-for-millions-of-u-s-jobs-after-california-s-uber-lyft-vote?sref=gni836kR\">Bloomberg reported<\/a>. Meanwhile, tech companies have spoken about implementing Prop 22-like legislation in other parts of the country. Martinez described how some California residents who voted to pass Prop 22 thought they were supporting workers for better access to rights.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>And unfortunately, you have workers who have possibly died. We have a California rideshare driver who died from COVID-19 last month. His independent classification means his family will receive no workers&#8217; compensation. That is a huge impact to workers and the reality of how it impacts day to day life for workers and in the midst of a pandemic. So I share that, because Prop 22 sets the tone, again, for what could happen nationally.\u00a0<strong><em>(Timestamp: 17:00)<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bain said she sees the passing of Prop 22 as a failure of &#8220;our entire structure of economy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>And we have really allowed tech to run rampant under this pretense that somehow it&#8217;s innovative, and especially within the gig economy. I mean, it&#8217;s the opposite of innovative, right? Like it&#8217;s feudalism on your phone, right? It&#8217;s 1-800 dial listserv. So it&#8217;s like, they&#8217;re not doing anything new that justifies creating an entirely different classification of labor than existed before, which is what Prop 22 did, right? It literally created this category of marketplace contractor that retains neither the protections of an independent contractor nor an employee. And allowing, you know, companies to write their own laws in this way is a systemic failure. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 18:57)<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/13\/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon\/\">An even bigger battle for gig worker rights is on the horizon<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/05\/gig-workers-survey-san-francisco\/\">Gig workers in San Francisco are mostly people of color and many are immigrants, according to survey<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/16\/ex-postmates-vp-of-global-public-policy-on-the-future-of-gig-work\/\">Ex-Postmates VP of global public policy on the future of gig work<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>On the PRO Act<\/h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s legislation in the U.S. Senate right now that aims to make it easier for workers to organize and form unions in the country.

The organization recently released a national agenda for worker safety and health, along with some recommendations.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We want stronger safety laws, tougher enforcement, including a mandatory emergency standard to prevent the spread of infectious disease. And again, this is federally so if there is an ETS or an emergency [temporary] standard pass, it applies all over and impacts all kinds of workers, stronger protections against retaliation.\u00a0<strong><em>(Timestamp: 07:53)<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Martinez added:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Employers will funnel resources to try scare tactics to scare workers from organizing, demanding safer workplaces, job security, and so forth. [The agenda] also includes workers are included in all policy decisions. We believe strongly that workers, more than anyone, understand the job, know the solutions and controls to health and safety issues, and also equity and inclusion to end the misclassification and better protections for temporary gig workers. Paid sick and family leave for workers, also worker centered health protocols, including health for high-risk workers and getting access to vaccines. And we want to confront the workplace effects of climate change. Finally, also prevent chemical catastrophes and harmful exposure. [&#8230;] With that said, this is not working in isolation. It works in collaboration with laws, we&#8217;re hoping that will pass, such as the PRO Act, allowing workers to gain bargaining power when organizing, essentially giving them the ability to negotiate with the employer to get access to benefits again, such as some job security paid sick leave, workers comp and so forth. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 8:23)<\/em><\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}\" data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:12801,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Open Sans&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:12}\"> <div embedded-video-placeholder=\"603fd6c1fb2e1e3363ff491c\" post-id=\"2120505\"><\/div> <\/span><\/p>\n<p>You can read the <a href=\"https:\/\/otter.ai\/u\/UGTB23Mu9JiPv-cYY5YHKQ3IZOA\">entire transcript here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/techcrunch-early-stage-is-the-startup-bootcamp-youve-always-needed\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">Early Stage<\/a> is the premier &#8220;how-to&#8221; event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

having a very large moment. Just last month, a piece of digital art by Beeple sold for $6.6 million on online art marketplace <a href=\"https:\/\/niftygateway.com\/\">Nifty Gateway.<\/a> Meanwhile, Linkin Park&#8217;s Mike Shinoda recently sold clips of a song <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inputmag.com\/culture\/linkin-park-mike-shinoda-happy-endings-nft-interview\">via online marketplace Zora<\/a>. Over on Dapper Labs&#8217; NBA Top Shot, more than 200,000 people recently waited hours for the chance to buy one of just 10,631 packs of digital NBA moments.<\/p>\n<p>Those marketplaces, along with others, are where people go to buy digital assets, or, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that live on the blockchain. This whole world of NFTs is super new to me (I&#8217;ve only been using Top Shot for a couple of weeks now) so I caught up with a couple of NFT creators to break it down for me, as well as share some insights on where they think the space is going, and its overall potential.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The way I like to explain NFTs, they are digital assets with true ownership and provenance,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/makersplace.com\/richardrivera\/\">Ronin the Collector <\/a>told TechCrunch. &#8220;You can track their origin and they can only be owned by one person.&#8221;<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2118455\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Many people, myself included, at some point wonder why someone would pay for a short video clip of, for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbatopshot.com\/moment\/mrd+ee07ddae-7658-4c39-93ca-b01643e0e814?\">Stephen Curry making a three-pointer<\/a> when you download it to your computer for free.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Humans inherently, whether we will like to admit it or not, want to own things,&#8221; Ronin said. &#8220;And I think that that&#8217;s part of the human experience is owning things. When you own things, it&#8217;s a connection, and it&#8217;s like you have reason for being and there&#8217;s something unique about ownership. And I think that at the end of the day, yeah, you can you can watch it all you want. But can you sell it?&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is the one!

As an example, one user bought a LeBron James dunk for $208,000 a couple of weeks ago, <a href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslam.io\/nba-top-shot\/sales\">according to CryptoSlam<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.nbatopshot.com\/posts\/state-of-nba-topshot?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=stateofnbatopshot_blog\">Last month<\/a>, Top Shot reached nearly $50 million in marketplace transactions. Then, over a 24-hour period last week, Top Shot saw more than $37 million in sales, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptoslam.io\/nba-top-shot\">according to Cryptoslam<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As to why they&#8217;re blowing up right now, Ronin attributes it to a couple of things: the pandemic that&#8217;s forced everyone behind a computer screen and an easy entry point. Top Shot, for example, makes it super easy for plebeians like me to sign up and you don&#8217;t need to have a crypto wallet. You can just use your credit card. The same goes for Nifty Gateway.<\/p>\n<p>But Top Shot and Nifty are outliers, Ronin said. For the majority of NFT platforms, you need to have an Ethereum wallet. As Cooper Turley, crypto strategy lead at Audius, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/27\/if-you-havent-followed-nfts-heres-why-you-should-start\/\">wrote on TC<\/a>, &#8220;this means collectors need to purchase ETH from an exchange like Coinbase and send it to a non-custodial address that consists of a long string of numbers and letters to get started.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That sounds like a whole thing that I, for one, am not ready to dive into. In general, barriers to access continue to be a problem in the NFTs space, Ronin said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Projects are just now starting to pay attention to the user experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And just barely in time. One of the best rooms I&#8217;ve been on Clubhouse was one that talked about how basically, with the whole world watching, how do we not mess this up. So I think when you have a product like Top Shot, which is easy to get into, easy to sign up for, and easy to purchase. You have to use a credit card, you don&#8217;t need crypto and throw in the mix that everyone&#8217;s online and then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/02\/24\/arts\/design\/christies-beeple-auction-blockchain-art.html\">Beeple sells $3 million worth of digital art<\/a>, and all of a sudden, people want to pay attention. So I think that was the catalyst.&#8221;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>But an even more expansive and interesting arena for NFTs than Top Shot is the world of NFT art. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sirsuhayb\">Ameer Carter<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/iamsirsu.com\/cryptomedia\">an artist<\/a> that is also known as Sirsu, got into NFTs last summer thanks to a friend, he told TechCrunch. Pretty much immediately, he said, he realized the transformative nature of the technology.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We literally have creative immortality,&#8221; he told me he realized at the time.<\/p>\n<p>But the art world has historically been inhospitable to Black folks and people of color, and especially in the world of NFTs, Carter said. The traditional art scene, Carter said, is elitist. And while Carter himself is a classically trained artist, he hasn&#8217;t been able to make his way into the traditional art world, he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not because of lack of trying,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Carter said he&#8217;s had a number of conversations with art curators who all love his work, but they&#8217;ve told him it&#8217;s not &#8220;something that they could build a whole curriculum around and intellectualize,&#8221; he said. What NFTs do is enable artists like Carter to create and share their art in a way that hadn&#8217;t previously been afforded to them.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SIRSU Trading Card Series, &quot;Androinomicon&quot; explores themes of human nature through alliteration and android motifs. <\/p>\n<p>Pack two: Pile \/ Push \/ Pull.<br \/>27 remaining! <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/XwmA04W01J\">pic.twitter.com\/XwmA04W01J<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; (vain) sirsu.eth (@sirsuhayb) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sirsuhayb\/status\/1354304148259409921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 27, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;And this is a much more open and accessible platform, and environment for them to do so,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And so my goal is to help really give them that type of visibility and empower them to be creatives. My mission is to remove the starving artists stigma. I don&#8217;t believe that creativity is cheap. I believe that it is rich. And it enriches and it gives us the reasons why we live in the first place.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>However, Carter said he&#8217;s begun to notice white folks taking credit for things Black artists have already done.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s this push and pull between folks who are really about the provenance of the blockchain versus folks who are wanting to predispose themselves as first because they have more visibility,&#8221; Carter said.<\/p>\n<p>He pointed to Black artists like <a href=\"https:\/\/danky.art\/portfolio\">Connie Digital<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.rarible.com\/harrisonfirst\">Harrison First<\/a> and others who were some of the first people to institute social tokens for their fans on the blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They were some of the first to deploy and sell albums as NFTs, EPs as NFTs, singular songs,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And now we have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/news-release\/2021\/02\/17\/2177446\/0\/en\/Acclaimed-Musician-3LAU-Launches-First-NFT-Album-on-Origin-s-Dshop.html\">Blau<\/a> that came out and people were saying he&#8217;s the first to sell an album. And it&#8217;s like, well, that&#8217;s not true, technically. But what works and has continued to work is because there&#8217;s a lot of hoopla and a lot of money around that sale, that becomes the formative thing as being first because it&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s made the most noise. And I find it interesting because of the fact that we can literally go back tangibly, and there&#8217;s verifiable hash proof that it wasn&#8217;t the case.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of phenomena pushing Carter to become an NFT archivist of sorts, he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not necessarily a historian, but I think the more and more I get involved in this space, the more and more I feel that pressing role of being an archivist,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So that culturally, we aren&#8217;t erased, even in a space that&#8217;s supposed to be decentralized and supposed to be something that works for everyone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s partly why Carter is building The Well to archive the work of Black artists, like <a href=\"https:\/\/linktr.ee\/blacksneakers\">Blacksneakers<\/a>, for example. The Well will also be a platform for Black artists to mint their NFTs in a place that feels safe, supportive and not exploitative, he said.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2119426\" style=\"width: 1235px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2119426\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2119426 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1225\" height=\"656\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png 1225w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png?resize=150,80 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png?resize=300,161 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png?resize=768,411 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png?resize=680,364 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1225px) 100vw, 1225px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2119426\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/superrare.co\/artwork-v2\/in-the-summer,-i-wish-to-be-with-you-13409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Sneakers via SuperRare <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>On current platforms, Carter said it feels like white artists generally get more promotions on the site, as well as on social media, than Black artists.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They deserve to have that kind of artists&#8217; growth and development,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;Yet it is afforded to a lot of other artists that don&#8217;t look like them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Carter said he recognizes it&#8217;s not the responsibility of platforms like Nifty Gateway, SuperRare and others to provide opportunities to Black artists, but that they do have the ability to put Black artists in a better position to receive opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s partly what Carter hopes to achieve with <a href=\"https:\/\/ownthewell.com\/\">The Well Protocol.<\/a> The Well, which Carter plans to launch on Juneteenth, aims to create an inclusive platform and ecosystem for NFT artists, collectors and curators. Carter said he wants artists to not have to feel like they have to constantly leverage Twitter to showcase their work. Instead, they&#8217;ll have the full backing of an ecosystem pumping up their work.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Everywhere else, you look at other artists and they have write-ups, and they have news coverage and things of that nature,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And [Black artists] don&#8217;t have a lot of those avenues to compete. You know, I&#8217;m in the business of building true equity for us, so part and parcel to that is developing the tools and the ecosystem for us to thrive.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>No longer should art just be for the rich, Carter said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have the ability to completely dismantle that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we have to be very, very, very careful about that and make a concerted effort to make that thing work, but we can&#8217;t do it when we have folks entering the space with money erasing folks who were already here. We can&#8217;t have that where platforms are not allowing the positioning of artists to grow. You know, we can&#8217;t have that when we have folks by and large, fear mongering and trying to get other artists to not be a part of this system.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important, he said, for NFTs to not solely be seen as collectible, investable objects.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s getting into the game like it&#8217;s a money grab,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s playing with artists lives and careers here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>For those who aren&#8217;t yet in on NFTs, there&#8217;s still time, Ronin said. Even with the increased attention on NFTs, Ronin says it&#8217;s still early days.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t even think we&#8217;ve got a full foot into early adoption yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you come out of early adoption until we&#8217;ve got a solid experience across the board. I think we&#8217;re still in alpha.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s partly because Ronin believes the things people will be able to do in five or ten years with this technology will pale in comparison to what&#8217;s happening today. For example, Ronin said he spoke with an artist who is experimenting with an NFT experience that will transcend VR, AR and XR.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m so excited that she chose to work with me and bring me in on this, and use me as kind of an advisor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And she can change the world with this technology.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s really what&#8217;s so exciting about NFTs for Ronin &#8212; the notion that the technology can change your life, and the world, he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And it is a space in which you should feel free to come into and dream big and then figure out how to make those dreams happen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can use AR, VR, mobile, you know, the internet &#8212; you can use all these aspects and create an NFT experience that transcends space, transcends time, transcends our life. So it&#8217;s a super powerful technology. And I think that people should really pay attention.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Down the road, Ronin also envisions having connected blockchains &#8220;where you can take an NFT from, you know, Bitcoin to Ethereum to <a href=\"https:\/\/on.wax.io\/wax-io\/\">WAX<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.onflow.org\/\">Flow,<\/a>&#8221; he said. &#8220;I really think that it&#8217;s why this this is that important.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For Carter, he hopes his work at The Well will help to set a precedent for inclusivity and access in the NFT space. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that Carter is also working on the <a href=\"https:\/\/mint.af\/\">Mint Fund<\/a> to help minimize the barriers to entry for artists looking to mint their first NFTs. Minting an NFT can be expensive to the tune of $50-$250 depending on how busy the Ethereum network is, and Mint Fund will pay those fees for new artists, making the on-ramp into the world smoother.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t do this the right way with the right type of community-driven thinking, then we will lose,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not going to look good, it&#8217;s going to be ugly. And it&#8217;s going to again perpetuate the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer&#8230;We have to find the best ways to redistribute wealth at any given point in time within this economy, within this system. If we do not know how to do that, we are fucked. At least in my opinion.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There are also conversations in the space around the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loop-news.com\/p\/the-big-problem-with-nfts-energy\">ecological impact of minting NFTs<\/a>, which requires a good amount of energy to do. Carter described the existence of two camps: the camp arguing minting NFTs are very ecologically damaging and the ones saying it&#8217;s not the fault of minters and you can&#8217;t blame them &#8220;for minting on a system that is already going to process these transactions, whether they mint or not.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For Carter, he thinks the first camp could be right, but says there&#8217;s just a lot of yelling at this point.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that collectively, us as minters should not feel so fucked up that we can&#8217;t do anything anymore,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Carter also pointed to the energy required to print and ship a bunch of his work.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To sell one piece of art that I&#8217;ve minted versus the energy expenditure and the emissions it takes for me to sell, let&#8217;s say 1,000 prints at $20,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To now shop those to 1,000 different places and for those things to then be transported to 1,000 different homes. Like, maybe they&#8217;re comparable, maybe they&#8217;re not. I&#8217;m not too interested in doing the math at this point.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Carter thinks there needs to be better access to renewable energy sources and more innovative hardware in the space.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And the production of creating that innovative hardware also has to be coming from renewable energy sources, like the entire framework should be working to be carbon negative,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As carbon neutral to carbon negative as possible. And not just the minting side but the mining side. And, you know, the manufacturing side. It&#8217;s a cyclical issue.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Digital collectibles are having a very large moment.

a $125 million fund, called Kapor Capital, Fund III, a source familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s notable about this fund is that it will be the first time Kapor Capital is accepting outside money from investors for a fund. Historically, the capital has come directly from Kapor Capital founders Mitch Kapor and Freada Kapor Klein.<\/p>\n<p>The fund will be led by Kapor Capital partners Brian Dixon and Ulili Onovakpuri. The two will function as co-managing partners.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2117388\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/06\/kapor-capital-promotes-ulili-onovakpuri-to-partner\/\">Onovakpuri was promoted<\/a> from principal to partner back in 2018. At the time, she told me she was interested in technology that makes access to healthcare more accessible, either through reimbursements to low-income people or through subsidized payments. On the people operations side, Onovakpuri said she was looking at investing in startups that help create inclusive cultures.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we have found is that more needs to be done in order to keep [people from diverse backgrounds] in and happy, so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve invested in,\u201d\u00a0Onovakpuri said.<\/p>\n<p>Her first couple of investments were in <a href=\"https:\/\/msurvey.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mSurvey<\/a>, which started as a text message platform to identify disparities in the world, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tequitable.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tEQuitable<\/a>, which aims to help companies be more inclusive.<\/p>\n<p>Her co-manager, Dixon, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/11\/10\/kapor-capital-invests-100000-in-three-people-operations-startups\/\">became one of the first Black investors to be promoted to partner at a venture capital firm in 2015<\/a>. At the time, Dixon told me he was focused on increasing the number of founders who identify as women and\/or an underrepresented person of color in Kapor Capital&#8217;s portfolio to above 50%.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cAs partner, that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to continue to do,\u201d Dixon said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re still looking for the best companies. We\u2019re still looking for companies that are going to be impact companies, but also have VC-like returns, so I think that\u2019s what unique about Kapor Capital, is that not many early-stage firms have that focus, and we think we do it pretty well.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Today, 59% of the companies in Kapor Capital&#8217;s portfolio have a founder who identifies as a woman and\/or an underrepresented person of color. Kapor Capital has been instrumental in advancing diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/01\/21\/kapor-capital-founders-commitment\/\">Back in 2016<\/a>, for example, Kapor Capital began requiring new portfolio companies to invest in diversity and inclusion as part of a Founders&#8217; Commitment.<\/p>\n<p>Kapor Capital has invested in companies like Blocpower, Bitwise, Promise and Aclima.<\/p>\n<p>Kapor Capital declined to comment for this story.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DsYoPz9egu\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/30\/freada-kapor-klein-warns-of-vulture-capitalists-during-the-pandemic\/\">Freada Kapor Klein warns of &#8216;vulture capitalists&#8217; during pandemic<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Freada Kapor Klein warns of &#8216;vulture capitalists&#8217; during pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/30\/freada-kapor-klein-warns-of-vulture-capitalists-during-the-pandemic\/embed\/#?secret=DsYoPz9egu\" data-secret=\"DsYoPz9egu\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Kapor Capital, the venture firm focused on funding social impact ventures and founders of color, is raising a $125 million fund, called Kapor Capital, Fund III, a source familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.

In a white paper, Uber proposed a \u201cnew standard\u201d for platform work, where it outlines the need to offer some benefits to workers while simultaneously steering away from the possibility of collective bargaining among workers. From TC\u2019s Natasha Lomas:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A universal standard for platform benefits may sound progressive, but the notion of \u201crelevant\u201d benefits for gig workers risks fixing this labor force to a floor far below agreed standards for employment \u2014 closing off any chance of a better deal for a class of workers who are subject to persistent, algorithmic management.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the U.K., <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/19\/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court\/\">the Supreme Court ruled<\/a> Uber drivers are employees and therefore entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/19\/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court\/\">Also from Lomas<\/a>:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The case, which\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/28\/uber-loses-employment-tribunal-in-the-uk\/\">dates back to 2016<\/a>, has major ramifications for Uber\u2019s business model (and other gig economy platforms) in the U.K. \u2014 and likely regionally, as similar employment rights challenges are ongoing in European courts.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3><b>DoorDash drivers are banding together to decline low-paying orders<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The strategy, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/3anwdy\/organized-doordash-drivers-declinenow-strategy-is-driving-up-their-pay\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reported on Vice<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is designed to beef up the base pay for drivers by working together to game the system.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From Vice:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fundamental principles of the official #DECLINENOW movement rely upon all drivers in the movement to exercise their right to use the decline button to decline lowball offers for higher, more feasible ones,\u201d reads a pinned post on the main Facebook group. \u201cDeclining lowball offers forces the algorithm to raise the base pay UP on the declined offer for the next driver as the need for DoorDash to service the order increases.

Mitchell announced the news <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mmitchell_ai\/status\/1362885356127801345\">via a tweet<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google confirmed Mitchell&#8217;s firing in a statement to TechCrunch; Google said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>After conducting a review of this manager\u2019s conduct, we confirmed that there were multiple violations of our code of conduct, as well as of our security policies, which included the exfiltration of confidential business-sensitive documents and private data of other employees.<\/p><\/blockquote><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2115555\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>In January, Google revoked corporate access from AI ethicist Margaret Mitchell for reportedly using automated scripts to find examples of mistreatment of Dr. Timnit Gebru, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/scoop-google-is-investigating-the-actions-of-another-top-ai-ethicist-50030739-ea3d-4ea2-b452-c228b4fc9773.html\">according to Axios<\/a>. Gebru says she was fired from Google while Google has maintained that she resigned.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, Mitchell said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>To everyone who has reached out to ask how I am doing, thank you from the bottom of my heart. It has meant the world to me. To the Ethical AI team that Dr. Timnit Gebru and I built, you are the most talented people I have ever had the honor of working with. You will all continue to be amazing whatever you do. To everyone I have been working with closely over the past 4 years, I have loved having you as my work family and thank you for working with me and believing in me. My regret is not being able to see our work through. Please know I tried to use my position to raise concerns to Google about race and gender inequity, and to speak up about Google\u2019s deeply problematic firing of Dr. Gebru. To now be fired has been devastating. It is my hope that speaking out will lead to one more step on the path of ethical AI.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Earlier this month, Mitchell <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mmitchell_ai\/status\/1357819673455202304\">published<\/a> the email she said she sent to Google&#8217;s press team the day her corporate email access was cut off. The email spoke about Gebru&#8217;s firing and how it appeared to be &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fueled by the same underpinnings of racism and sexism that our AI systems, when in the wrong hands, tend to soak up.&#8221;<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Mitchell&#8217;s letter, which you can <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1ERi2crDToYhYjEjxRoOzO-uOUeLgdoLPfnx1JOErg2w\/edit\">read in full here,<\/a> details the different ideas and structures at play that led to Dr. Gebru&#8217;s departure from Google. Mitchell argues what happened to Gebru &#8220;appears to stem from the same lack of foresight that is at the core of modern technology, and so itself serves as an example of the problem.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Mitchell adds:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The firing seems to have been fueled by the same underpinnings of racism and sexism that our AI systems, when in the wrong hands, tend to soak up. How Dr. Gebru was fired is not okay, what was said about it is not okay, and the environment leading up to it was &#8212; and is &#8212; not okay. Every moment where <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/timnitGebru\/status\/1334352694664957952\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeff Dean and Megan Kacholia do not take responsibility for their actions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is another moment where the company as a whole stands by silently as if to intentionally send the horrifying message that Dr. Gebru deserves to be treated this way. Treated as if she were inferior to her peers. Caricatured as irrational (and worse). Her research writing publicly defined as below the bar.\u00a0 Her scholarship publicly declared to be insufficient. For the record: Dr. Gebru has been treated completely inappropriately, with intense disrespect, and she deserves an apology.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The letter went on to discuss the ethical artificial intelligence approach to developing technology, how Mitchell came to lead and then co-lead the ethical AI team with Gebru and what ultimately happened. Within the next year, Mitchell said she wanted &#8220;those of us in positions of privilege and power&#8221; to come to terms with &#8220;the discomfort of being part of an unjust system that devalued one of the world&#8217;s leading scientists, and keep something like this from ever happening again.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Mitchell&#8217;s firing comes shortly after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/18\/google-has-a-new-responsible-ai-lead\/\">Google announced the appointment of Dr. Marian Croak<\/a> to lead its responsible artificial intelligence division.

Most institutions have only developed principles, and they\u2019re very high-level, abstract principles, in the last five years. There\u2019s a lot of dissension, a lot of conflict in terms of trying to standardize on normative definitions of these principles. Whose definition of fairness, or safety, are we going to use? There\u2019s quite a lot of conflict right now within the field, and it can be polarizing at times. And what I\u2019d like to do is have people have the conversation in a more diplomatic way, perhaps, than we\u2019re having it now, so we can truly advance this field.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2114996\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This all comes after the departure of Dr. Timnit Gebru, the former co-lead of Google&#8217;s ethical AI team, as well as the corporate lockout of researcher Margaret Mitchell, founder of Google&#8217;s ethical AI team. <\/span>In January, Google revoked corporate access from AI ethicist Margaret Mitchell for reportedly using automated scripts to find examples of mistreatment of Gebru, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/scoop-google-is-investigating-the-actions-of-another-top-ai-ethicist-50030739-ea3d-4ea2-b452-c228b4fc9773.html\">according to Axios<\/a>.

barriers to accessing stable jobs, housing and financial services. These types of barriers are a key driver of recidivism for the more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prisonpolicy.org\/reports\/outofwork.html\">600,000 people who are released from prison each year<\/a>. Between 2005 and 2014, an estimated 68% of people released in 2005 were arrested again within three years. Within nine years, 83% of those released in 2005 were rearrested, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bjs.gov\/content\/pub\/pdf\/18upr9yfup0514.pdf\">according to the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of Justice Statistics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/centerforjustice.columbia.edu\/justicethroughcode#\/text-296\">Justice Through Code<\/a>, a semester-long coding and interpersonal skills intensive that takes place at Columbia University, aims to provide alternative paths for people once they reenter society.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the semester, students learn the fundamentals of Python and other computer science basics. They also receive career coaching, public speaking training, and learn negotiation skills and how to write a resume. Once students complete the program, Justice Through Code, which held its first cohort last year with just over 30 students, puts them in touch with its partners for paid internships and jobs.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2113608\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Of the students in the first cohort who were interested in finding jobs or internships after the program, more than 80% of them were placed in relevant roles within six months, Justice Through Code founder Aedan Macdonald told TechCrunch. Antwan (pictured above) is one of the graduates who secured an internship after the program. Antwan has been interning full time at Columbia in the school&#8217;s IT department since December.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It was just amazing that within one year of me coming across that flyer [for Justice Through Code] on Facebook, I&#8217;m actually working an internship at Columbia,&#8221; Antwan told TechCrunch. &#8220;And it&#8217;s just been tremendous. I mean, it&#8217;s been nonstop learning every single day.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Before that, Antwan spent time at Emergent Works.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It really gave me my first opportunity of using the theory that I learned in the program in a work setting,&#8221; Antwan said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Justice Through Code works with a handful of tech partners to support its program and its students. Amazon Web Services, for example, provides laptops to students who need them while technologists from Google, Slack and Coursera speak to students on their experiences in tech.<\/p>\n<p>AWS has yet to hire folks from the program but an AWS spokesperson says the company is excited to present opportunities to graduates.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely our intention to hire individuals from this program,&#8221; the spokesperson told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>Justice Through Code is now <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfJ6E-pW1xOeO6ud-_td8Hx_2n7PfVmbFVVa-Nj1pGIh9B1qQ\/viewform?usp=send_form\">accepting applications<\/a> for its third cohort, which Macdonald says he hopes will have a class size of up to 60 people. While Justice Through Code does not require applicants to have any prior coding experience, the program does want participants to be comfortable using computers. The application process also seeks to determine how well someone may be equipped to deal with the frustrations that come with learning how to code.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So much of learning how to code is being in a kind of state where you don&#8217;t know everything,&#8221; Macdonald said. &#8220;And it can be highly frustrating. And so I think seeing how the process of how people work through problems [is beneficial]. We do a couple logic problems in the interview, and it&#8217;s really not a matter of does somebody have the answer to this, but we actually have questions in pairs. So if somebody struggles on one question, we&#8217;ll go through in detail how to solve that and then see what their process is of applying that same principle of logic to the subsequent question that utilizes the same principle. So \u2026 how people are responding in a learning environment, as well as kind of curiosity about the the industry and just a real drive to succeed if they&#8217;re selected to participate in the program.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Justice Through Code is not the only program that serves folks impacted by the criminal justice system. The Last Mile teaches folks business and coding skills while incarcerated, and similarly has partnerships in place with tech companies to help returned citizens find jobs.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tr7n58TGRT\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/03\/24\/san-quentin-coding-school-the-last-mile\/\">What it&#8217;s like at San Quentin&#8217;s coding school<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;What it&#8217;s like at San Quentin&#8217;s coding school&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/03\/24\/san-quentin-coding-school-the-last-mile\/embed\/#?secret=tr7n58TGRT\" data-secret=\"tr7n58TGRT\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Macdonald, who himself spent time in prison, says he hopes Justice Through Code can help to shift &#8220;the negative stereotypes of the formerly incarcerated as not having any future beyond a minimum wage job.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>People who have spent time in jail or prison often face barriers to accessing stable jobs, housing and financial services.

communications at Postmates, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@vikrum\/an-exit-memo-on-the-gig-economy-58b9210988a8\">penned a memo<\/a> to his former colleagues and other stakeholders in the gig economy outlining what he thinks needs to happen next in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>In his letter, Aiyer says &#8220;it would be a mistake for us to think that mild tweaks to worker classification, or a single state ballot measure, create a durable path forward for meaningfully addressing what Americans truly worry about: the chance to work, take care of their families, and not fret about what comes next.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He goes on to say how tech platforms, labor advocates and other stakeholders &#8220;are not willing to evolve and give an inch on their respective models,&#8221; which means &#8220;we&#8217;ll never see progress that both empowers on-demand work and improves the social safety net.&#8221; Aiyer wants &#8220;this uncivil war that pits workers against capital, tech against labor unions, conservative versus liberal&#8221; to end.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2113207\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>In the letter, Aiyer puts forth a handful of recommendations for on-demand tech companies. He <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proposes, for example, that companies give board seats with voting rights to workers, embrace portable benefits \u201cthat can close the gap between what\u2019s available to W2 and independent workers\u201d and consider sectoral bargaining for gig workers:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sectoral bargaining for independent workers would be an innovative reform that could provide <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sector-wide floors on earnings and benefits, while retaining IC classification. Some in <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">organized labor have suggested extending the right to bargain for all workers &#8211;regardless <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of classification. Before industry dismisses this outright, and since this has not been done <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">before in the US, it warrants critical examination by Congress, the GAO, or university labor <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">centers to explore how card check rules, antitrust laws, and federal preemptions would be <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">accounted for. In concept, this could empower workers and prevent less scrupulous <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">companies from gaining a competitive advantage with a race to the bottom.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While Aiyer, along with Postmates and Uber, was a proponent of California&#8217;s Proposition 22, which legally classified gig workers as independent contractors, he says he does not want a carbon copy of it to be implemented throughout the country.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;While Prop 22 was a step forward when it comes to the argument that tech is making of balancing worker flexibility with more benefits on top of the 1099 status, there are two issues that need to prescribe the rest of the path forward,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The first is that this type of work has become rather popular, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to millions of lost jobs throughout the country. Secondly, Aiyer says it&#8217;s important to get input from workers as companies push similar legislation either in other parts of the country or at the federal level.<\/p>\n<p>Aiyer pointed to a key difference in Postmates couriers in Los Angeles versus New York. In Los Angeles, Aiyer said many Postmates couriers are in cars, while in New York, many are on bikes. Prop 22 put forth a new floor for insurance standard, but &#8220;that might not be the same type of coverage someone on a bike wants.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Prop 22 established a floor for California, but it certainly is not the ceiling of broader safety net reforms and what a nationwide policy should look like,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>But for some gig workers, they have long said they don&#8217;t want to be independent contractors &#8212; even if that does come with some extra benefits. Instead, some have said they want to be employees and be entitled to the full range of benefits that W-2 status provides.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"WTapxryic4\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/13\/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon\/\">An even bigger battle for gig worker rights is on the horizon<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;An even bigger battle for gig worker rights is on the horizon&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/13\/an-even-bigger-battle-for-gig-worker-rights-is-on-the-horizon\/embed\/#?secret=WTapxryic4\" data-secret=\"WTapxryic4\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Ultimately, Aiyer thinks it&#8217;s a false dichotomy to have a binary in our society where there are workers with benefits and independent workers without.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;What about having both a W-2 full-time employee model and you can raise the standard of independent work to a new height of benefits and you can have both,&#8221; Aiyer said. &#8220;But to do that in a way that is inclusive to workers and labor advocates, you need to have a reset of those conversations, which haven&#8217;t really been taking place since AB 5.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Aiyer, whose last day at Uber-owned Postmates was in early January, told me he hopes for his letter to reinvigorate conversations between the different stakeholders in the space.

the &#8216;pipeline problem&#8217;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">The tech industry<\/span> has long grappled with an overwhelming lack of diversity among employees, executives, venture-backed founders, venture capital firms and board members. And despite recent efforts to increase diversity throughout the industry, tech still remains predominantly white and male.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, many have argued that the lack of diversity in tech is caused by a so-called pipeline problem: that there is little diversity in tech because there is not enough qualified talent from diverse backgrounds.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, there is<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/02\/26\/upshot\/dont-blame-recruiting-pipeline-for-lack-of-diversity-in-tech.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">well-established data<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that proves the lack of diversity in tech cannot be attributed to a pipeline problem, Uber Chief Diversity Officer Bo Young Lee told TechCrunch.<\/span><\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2112135\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;If we want to claim that it&#8217;s a pipeline issue, we would first have to claim that we&#8217;ve hired what is available in the pipeline,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a pipeline issue as much as it is a recruiting process challenge.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>But the notion that there is a pipeline problem, despite the evidence showing there is not one, at least partly remains in the public psyche. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Courri Brady, director at diversity, equity and inclusion consulting firm Paradigm, recognizes there are still some folks who have yet to rid themselves of the myth of the pipeline problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;There&#8217;s still a perception to some degree that there&#8217;s a pipeline problem within some companies that I&#8217;m personally supporting,&#8221; Brady told TechCrunch. &#8220;But there are a couple of dynamics at play.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those dynamics, Brady said, pertains to recruiting processes, which are relatively fixed inside tech companies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>If companies are convinced only certain schools, programs or other companies are the only places that produce good talent, and those people are not diverse, Brady said, &#8220;then those issues are going to perpetuate themselves.&#8221;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/joyrankin.com\/\">Dr. Joy Lisi Rankin<\/a>, a research lead for gender, race and power in artificial intelligence at the <a href=\"https:\/\/ainowinstitute.org\/\">AI Now Institute<\/a>, is actively researching the history of the pipeline problem. In the next six months, the plan is to publish it as a report and potentially turn it into a book. Rankin was kind of enough to give TechCrunch a sneak peek into some of her research so far.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The very high-level view is, people have been talking about a pipeline problem in some form since the seventies,&#8221; Rankin told me. &#8220;And before that, often, it was like a quote, manpower problem, by focusing on who has PhDs or master&#8217;s degrees in a field or who has elite jobs in a field. But that focus is always on individuals. It&#8217;s on tracking people, not institutions and not structures. So this is why I think it continues to be a convenient excuse for a host of sins, because talking about a pipeline makes it seem as if all things are equal in the United States, and we just have to find a way to keep people in. But the truth is, when we think about a STEM pipeline, we don&#8217;t talk about the fact that education in the United States is by no means equal from birth onwards.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There are, of course, programs like Black Girls Code, Girls Who Code, Code.org and others that aim to step in to help introduce kids to technology. But these issues go deeper than just STEM education, Rankin said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For a long time, it was you had to have a certain SAT score to get in somewhere or a certain GRE score for graduate school,&#8221; Rankin said. &#8220;But we know, literally decades of research have shown SATs correlate in no way with how you&#8217;re going to do in college or how you might be as a student, but correlate everything with how wealthy your family is, which also then correlates with race and access to all other sorts of things like tutoring and etc. But that same time of credentialing pops up time and time again.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The entire education system has historically functioned as a gatekeeper to knowledge through credentialing, she said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Credentialing is a form of gatekeeping and protecting who has access to power and who doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There&#8217;s this term that I think was coined a few years ago about how Silicon Valley tech companies are not meritocracies, but &#8216;mirrortocracies,&#8217; so you&#8217;re hiring people who have similar credentials to you, had the same sort of schooling, etcetera. But that doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean they&#8217;re more qualified. We know that all sorts of diversity often yields better work and better outcomes in a variety of situations, but focusing on certain types of quote, qualifications and credentials, don&#8217;t reflect that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Beyond education, however, there are also other pipelines at play. There&#8217;s the cradle to prison pipeline, which I&#8217;ve referred to as &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/07\/31\/the-other-pipeline\/\">the other pipeline<\/a>,&#8221; as well as &#8220;the revolving door of H1B visa workers who are treated with lower status,&#8221; Rankin said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"HbQhP58tRl\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/07\/31\/the-other-pipeline\/\">The other pipeline<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The other pipeline&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/07\/31\/the-other-pipeline\/embed\/#?secret=HbQhP58tRl\" data-secret=\"HbQhP58tRl\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The pipeline is a way to silo all of that out and say, &#8216;we just need to get more Black women in tech,&#8217; as opposed to saying, &#8216;actually, these companies are and have been racist and white supremacist and misogynist, and it&#8217;s those institutions and larger societal and global capitalist structures that need to change.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>What the idea of the pipeline also doesn&#8217;t capture is the fact that women were often tasked with doing manual computing in the 1950s and sixties, Rankin said. Back then, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/02\/13\/magazine\/women-coding-computer-programming.html\">many considered coding to be a woman&#8217;s job<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And it was only as it became clear how socially and economically and politically important that computing would be, that the profession over a decade or so became masculine. [&#8230;] It clearly shows that as certain types of computing and programming became culturally valuable, more of those jobs that were better paying went to men. And it wasn&#8217;t that the work was any different but that because there was a prestige shift, there was also a shift in how it was gendered.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Those are just some of the ideas Rankin will outline in her research paper, which she hopes will help to change the conversation happening in the tech industry about diversity, equity and inclusion. Instead of relying on the pipeline as an excuse, Rankin said she hopes the tech industry will focus more on inequities, structural racism, misogyny and how micro-inequities can lead to macro problems.<\/p>\n<p>Rankin&#8217;s report will also have some recommendations, such as working to make education truly equitable and addressing surveillance, as well as the school to prison pipeline. She also believes salary data should be public information.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As soon as we have more transparency around salaries, we can have more meaningful conversations,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/08\/silenced-no-more-act-seeks-to-ban-use-of-ndas-in-situations-involving-harassment-or-discrimination\/\">Last week<\/a>, former Pinterest employee Ifeoma Ozoma introduced legislation with the backing of California State Senator Connie Leyva to empower those who experience workplace discrimination and\/or harassment. The Silenced No More Act (SB 331) would prevent the use of non-disclosure agreements in workplace situations involving all forms of discrimination and harassment.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s certainly a step in the right direction,&#8221; Rankin said.<\/p>\n<p>The proposed bill would expand the current protections workers have through the Stand Together Against Non-Disclosures Act, also authored by Leyva, that went into effect in 2019. Ozoma, along with former co-worker Aerica Shimizu Banks, came forward with claims of both racial and gender discrimination last year. They eventually settled with Pinterest, but the STAND Act technically only protected them for speaking out about gender discrimination. This new bill would ensure workers are also protected when speaking out about racial discrimination.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It would be huge and not just for tech, but for your industry as well,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/08\/silenced-no-more-act-seeks-to-ban-use-of-ndas-in-situations-involving-harassment-or-discrimination\/\">Ozoma told me earlier this week<\/a>. &#8220;I believe that we don&#8217;t have real progress unless we approach things intersectionally and that&#8217;s the lesson from all of us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Meredith Whittaker, AI Now Faculty Director and co-organizer of the 2018 Google walkout, said this type of legislation absolutely necessary.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;From a structural perspective, it&#8217;s really evident we&#8217;re not going to change toxic, discriminatory tech environments without naming the problems,&#8221; Whittaker told TechCrunch. &#8220;We have decades of failed DEI PR, decades of people blaming the pipeline and decades of brilliant people like Ifeoma, Aerica and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/03\/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email\/\">Timnit<\/a> being harassed and pushed out of these environments. And oftentimes, people aren&#8217;t able to speak about their experiences so that the deep toxicity of these environments &#8212; the way it&#8217;s built into the structural operating procedures of these companies and workplaces &#8212; doesn&#8217;t get aired.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There also needs to be more transparency around hiring and corporate recruiting, Rankin said. Pinterest, which was one of the first companies to set goals around diversity, <a href=\"https:\/\/newsroom.pinterest.com\/en\/post\/diversity-report-2020\">disclosed last year<\/a> that its hiring rates for women engineers, underrepresented minority engineers and underrepresented employees. But there&#8217;s room for even more transparency, like how many new hires come from partnerships with schools, coding bootcamps and other programs.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/d1nyezh1ys8wfo.cloudfront.net\/static\/PDFs\/CR24198_BOS-CWW_Uber_2020_Diversity_Report.pdf?uclick_id=85bc6a82-8520-44dd-8b82-ca6f13f82b32\">In Uber&#8217;s most recent diversity report<\/a>, Uber talks about university recruiting, diversifying internship programs and more but the company&#8217;s reported data does not disclose how many hires came from those efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Uber&#8217;s Bo Young Lee says the company is working on better tracking its top-of-funnel pipeline to ensure it&#8217;s representative of the available talent. This is called the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.diversitylab.com\/mansfield-rule-4-0\/#:~:text=The%20Mansfield%20Rule%2C%20inspired%20by,partner%20promotions%2C%20formal%20client%20pitch\">Mansfield rule<\/a>, which takes the Rooney Rule &#8212; which requires companies to interview at least one or more diverse candidate for an open roles &#8212;\u00a0 a couple of steps further. If Uber gets this right, then 14% of its recruiting pipeline would be Black and Hispanic, Lee said, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/02\/26\/upshot\/dont-blame-recruiting-pipeline-for-lack-of-diversity-in-tech.html\">citing a 2016 New York Times article about engineering graduates<\/a>. It&#8217;s early days for Uber&#8217;s implementation of the Mansfield Rule, but the plan is to publish some of the data, Lee said. Though, she hasn&#8217;t yet decided exactly what that will look like.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/kstatic.googleusercontent.com\/files\/25badfc6b6d1b33f3b87372ff7545d79261520d821e6ee9a82c4ab2de42a01216be2156bc5a60ae3337ffe7176d90b8b2b3000891ac6e516a650ecebf0e3f866\">Meanwhile, in Google&#8217;s latest diversity report<\/a>, the company outlined how more than 1,300 women in Latin America were trained on web development and UX design with the help of Google volunteers and a Google.org grant. As a result, Google said 75% of the women who participated found jobs in tech. What Google did not mention, however, was how many women found jobs at Google.<\/p>\n<p>In that same report, Google mentioned that it hired from 15 Historically Black College and Universities (HBCUs), 39 Hispanic-serving institutions and nine women&#8217;s colleges in the U.S. That all sounds good, but in December, <a href=\"https:\/\/redirect.viglink.com\/?format=go&amp;jsonp=vglnk_161307400352510&amp;key=07fc33cfae8c975920593b7e84c31bbc&amp;libId=kl1aj1c20102c1o6000DLc64jqh5z&amp;loc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Fdiversity-recruiter-april-christina-curley-says-google-fired-her-because-she-flagged-their-racist-bullshit&amp;v=1&amp;out=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FRealAbril%2Fstatus%2F1341135819487100928&amp;ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;title=Diversity%20Recruiter%3A%20Google%20Fired%20Me%20Because%20I%20Called%20It%20Out%20on%20%E2%80%98Racist%20Bullshit%E2%80%99&amp;txt=opened%20up%20about%20her%20firing%20in%20a%20lengthy%20Twitter%20thread%20Monday%20night\">former Google diversity recruiter April Curley came forward<\/a> about how she was fired after she &#8220;became aware of all the racist shit put in place to keep black and brown students out of their pipeline.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a large team of recruiters who work incredibly hard to increase the hiring of Black+ and other underrepresented talent at Google, including a dedicated team that partners and strengthens our relationships with HBCUs,&#8221; a Google spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;This work is critical &#8211; in 2019 we welcomed graduates from 19 HBCUs and over the past decade, we\u2019ve expanded our recruiting efforts to more than 800 schools. At the same time, we are absolutely committed to maintaining an inclusive and supportive workplace.\u00a0 We don\u2019t agree with the way April describes her termination, but it\u2019s not appropriate for us to provide a commentary about her claims.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Despite what may have happened at Google or what happens at other tech companies, it&#8217;s the overall lack of transparency around recruiting processes with which Rankin takes issue.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s its own form of pipeline that is problematic and inequitable,&#8221; Rankin said. &#8220;[&#8230;] But how do you break down the scale of the problem so that it&#8217;s not just focusing on individuals.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Rankin does not work inside tech companies and can&#8217;t speak to the inner workings of DEI departments, but said she does believe there are good people who are trying to make things better.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think this is a larger problem of education and perspective and how you can get to a point where you have an engineering degree or you get hired by a tech company and you&#8217;ve never had to think about race as a deeply rooted historical, structural problem,&#8221; she said. &#8220;[&#8230;] I think it&#8217;s convenient to disregard some of these larger issues and at some point, ignorance isn&#8217;t an excuse, especially given the events of the past few years.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The tech industry has long grappled with an overwhelming lack of diversity among employees, executives, venture-backed founders, venture capital firms and board members.

The Silenced No More Act (SB 331) would prevent the use of non-disclosure agreements in workplace situations involving all forms of discrimination and harassment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt was a legal gamble,\u201d Ozoma told TechCrunch about coming forward with claims of both racial and gender discrimination, despite having signed an NDA. Pinterest could\u2019ve decided to sue both Ozoma and Banks, Ozoma said, but that would\u2019ve required the company to admit wrongdoing.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>Meredith Whittaker, faculty director at AI Now and Google walkout co-organizer on SB 331<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also caught up with Whittaker, who said this type of legislation is absolutely necessary:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a structural perspective, it&#8217;s really evident we&#8217;re not going to change toxic, discriminatory tech environments without naming the problems. We have decades of failed DEI PR, decades of people blaming the pipeline and decades of brilliant people like Ifeoma, Aerica and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/03\/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timnit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> being harassed and pushed out of these environments. And oftentimes, people aren&#8217;t able to speak about their experiences so that the deep toxicity of these environments &#8212; the way it&#8217;s built into the structural operating procedures of these companies and workplaces &#8212; doesn&#8217;t get aired.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>Musings on the pipeline problem<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My conversation with Whittaker led to me being introduced to Dr. Joy Lisi Rankin, a research lead for gender, race and power in artificial intelligence at the<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ainowinstitute.org\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI Now Institute<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. She\u2019s actively researching the history of the pipeline problem and took some time to chat with me about it. I\u2019m not done with the story yet, but here\u2019s a little teaser:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The very high-level view is, people have been talking about a pipeline problem in some form since the seventies,&#8221; Rankin told me. &#8220;And before that, often, it was like a quote, manpower problem, by focusing on who has PhDs or master&#8217;s degrees in a field or who has elite jobs in a field. But that focus is always on individuals. It&#8217;s on tracking people, not institutions and not structures. So this is why I think it continues to be a convenient excuse for a host of sins, because talking about a pipeline makes it seem as if all things are equal in the United States, and we just have to find a way to keep people in. But the truth is, when we think about a STEM pipeline, we don&#8217;t talk about the fact that education in the United States is by no means equal from birth onwards.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>Ex-Salesforce manager alleges microaggressions and inequity<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cynthia Perry, a former design research senior manager at Salesforce who left earlier this month, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/08\/ex-salesforce-manager-alleges-microaggressions-and-inequity\/\">posted her resignation letter on LinkedIn that detailed her negative treatment at the company.<\/a>\u00a0In it, Perry, a Black woman, alleges she experienced \u201ccountless microaggressions and inequity\u201d during her time there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, Perry said she left her job because she had been \u201cGaslit, manipulated, bullied, neglected, and mostly unsupported\u201d by folks she chose not to name.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salesforce provided the following statement to TechCrunch:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For privacy reasons, we can\u2019t comment on individual employee matters but Equality is one of our highest values and we have been dedicated to its advancement both inside and outside of our company since we were founded almost 22 years ago.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>All Raise aims to increase diversity at the board level<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite recent efforts to improve diversity at the board level, the number of Black, brown and women board members is still low.
