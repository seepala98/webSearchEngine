Since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in late February, Delfast\u2019s top priority has been to see its Ukrainian team of 30 safely evacuated from the most dangerous parts of the country.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n When not focusing on sales, marketing, R&D and customer support, Delfast\u2019s smaller team of seven employees based in Los Angeles has been pleading with U.S. politicians and the European Commission to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and fighter jets that could help Ukraine gain back some control over its air space, and, hopefully, put a stop to this war.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Delfast\u2019s co-founders, Daniel Tonkopi and Serhiy Denysenko, say they have always believed in safeguarding the future. When they founded Delfast in 2014, originally as a delivery company, Tonkoply and Denysenko knew that providing couriers with green transportation options would be critical to the company\u2019s operations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n \t \n\t\t \n\t\t\tThe most important thing for an entrepreneur, and in general for any leader, is to protect the team and be completely honest with them during a tough time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDaniel Tonkopi, co-founder of Delfast<\/cite>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/span><\/p>\n The founders soon realized that a bike with the power, range and battery life their couriers needed didn\u2019t exist, and so they set out to build one. In 2017, backed by a Kickstarter campaign that saw the company raise $165,000, the startup began manufacturing a bike to fit its needs \u2013 one that promptly <\/span>won the Guinness Book of World Records<\/span><\/a> for the greatest distance traveled on an electric motorbike on a single charge.<\/span><\/p>\n More recently, the Delfast Top 3.0 e-motorbike <\/span>won Forbes\u2019 fastest e-bike of the year<\/span><\/a> in 2022 after the company announced some serious <\/span>upgrades to the vehicle during CES<\/span><\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n We spoke with Delfast\u2019s co-founders to discuss what it\u2019s like running a startup during a war, how the startup is considering breaking into new business verticals, and the importance of always having a Plan B.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n Note: Serhiy Denysenko\u2019s answers were translated from Ukrainian by a member of Delfast\u2019s team for TechCrunch.\u00a0<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n TC: Serhiy, you’re on the ground in Kyiv. What’s your day-to-day like?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues. It\u2019s important to keep in touch and know that everyone is fine, or as fine as is possible right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n Besides my work as a COO, I\u2019ve been helping with volunteering, getting supplies and medicine to people, and this is something that pretty much every Ukrainian is now doing. I had my family relocated to Hungary, so I feel more or less safe, and I\u2019m just trying to work as much as possible and do my best in every possible area, whether that\u2019s supporting the company or supporting Ukraine in general.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n How are you managing your team through this crisis? What\u2019s changed?<\/b><\/p>\n Denysenko: <\/b>We got used to working remotely during Coronavirus times, so we have our task tracker, where everyone can see his or her task. Every Monday, we have an online Zoom meeting. Previously we only had these meetings at the executive level, but now during the war, we are gathering all together, just to see each other\u2019s faces and ask how they\u2019re doing, how\u2019s everyone feeling. Just to talk with everybody.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n <\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":" “Every morning starts with a check-in on Slack with all the colleagues.

But second, and more immediately relevant in this case, you would not know that there is a technique to it that, surprisingly, robots aren’t super good at because they tend to be… crushy. But this robo-berry<\/a> designed by Swiss researchers could usher in a new era of gentle, automated robo-pickers.<\/p>\n The secret to picking a raspberry is to grip it just enough to get purchase and then pull it downwards off the little stem, apparently called the “receptacle,” which seems backwards. Seems simple \u2014 and it is, but only our hands are among the most sensitive and finely controlled constructions in the universe, the culmination of a hundred million years of evolution, outdone only by (I suspect) raccoons.<\/p>\n Robots simply don’t have the senses necessary to figure out the perfect technique for picking a berry. But what if it could communicate with the berry to better sense the forces involved and avoid either a a brutal crushing or humiliating failure-to-detach?<\/p> <\/div>\n That’s what Kai Junge, a PhD student at EPFL in Switzerland, aims to accomplish with this “sensorized raspberry,” a silicone and silicon replica berry that provides feedback to the picking machine, allowing it to learn to pick faster and better \u2014 and cleaner.<\/p>\n “It\u2019s an exciting dilemma for us as robotics engineers,” said professor Josie Hughes, who worked with Junge on the project. “The raspberry harvesting season is so short, and the fruit is so valuable, that wasting them simply isn’t an option. What’s more, the cost and logistical challenges of testing different options out in the field are prohibitive. That\u2019s why we decided to run our tests in the lab and develop a replica raspberry for training harvesting robots.”<\/p>\n Apparently the hard part comes just at the moment of detaching, when the force needed to grip the berry on the receptacle suddenly becomes overkill as the object goes from solid to hollow.<\/p>\n The replica berry has a fluidic sensor that tells the system how much compression is being experienced by the silicone drooplets, allowing the control model to learn how to adjust its grip as if the berry itself is telling it how much is too much.<\/p>\n You can see the berry in action below:<\/p>\n <\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The team plans to present their work at RobotSoft in April. And once the raspberry question is decided, they may move on to other berries, tomatoes, grapes&#8230; even apricots.

It\u2019s a usual occurrence &#8212; for instance, when BuzzFeed went public last December, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/buzzfeed-suffers-wave-of-spac-investor-withdrawals-before-going-public-11638472756\">94% of the $287.5 million raised by the SPAC <\/a><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/buzzfeed-suffers-wave-of-spac-investor-withdrawals-before-going-public-11638472756\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was withdrawn<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212; particularly as the SPAC hype gives way in the face of an underperforming market and tighter regulation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the seeming setback, there\u2019s good news for Swvl. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to CFO Youssef Salem, the company has an <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">additional $600 million from proceeds and<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> committed equity facility with B. Riley Principal to access over the next few weeks if certain conditions are met, he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Swvl was founded by <a href=\"https:\/\/eg.linkedin.com\/in\/mostafa-kandil-57761032\">Mostafa Kandil<\/a>, Mahmoud Nouh and Ahmed Sabbah in 2017. The trio started the company as a bus-hailing service in Egypt and other ride-sharing services in emerging markets with fragmented public transportation.<\/p>\n<p>Its bus-hailing services enable users to make intra-state journeys by booking seats on buses running a fixed route. Swvl offerings have expanded beyond bus-hailing services, though. Now, the company offers inter-city rides, car ride-sharing, and corporate services in the 10 cities it operates in across Africa and the Middle East.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The partnership between Swvl and Queen\u2019s Gambit came from a mutual interest from both parties<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While searching for a company to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acquire<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl fit the blank-check company\u2019s criteria: strong business fundamentals, mobility and logistics (one of its core verticals), and an ESG ethos around women and affordable transportation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Swvl &#8212; off the back of raising over $170 million in venture capital, expanding to over 16 countries across Latin America, Asia and Africa; hiring executives from Facebook, Uber and Optimus; and acquiring Shotl, Viapool and door2door &#8212; was on a quest for global dominance in the mobility space. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A SPAC with Queen\u2019s Gambit was the most suitable option for it from a financial standpoint, and both parties feel strongly about the sustainability angle around transport &#8212; Swvl claims it has prevented approximately 289 million pounds of carbon emissions since its inception.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company plans to expand into several countries over the next six months, including Colombia, Mexico, South Africa, and the U.S. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the meantime, all eyes will be on the company\u2019s performance as it <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">officially<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> starts trading tomorrow in a cooling SPAC market and a generally unsettled public market.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s a softness in the market, but as long as the company operates and delivers results, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">maybe<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> today, people don\u2019t pay attention to it, but they will in months ahead,\u201d Grace said about the worrying SPAC and public markets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the market will change <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like it always does and people go back to fundamentals at how we look at company\u2019s performances. For Swvl, they have been beating every single number that was ever presented to us. And that\u2019s what makes me super excited about this.

But with Minit, the tech giant is doubling down on a software category that could be worth over $11 billion by 2030, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wfmz.com\/news\/pr_newswire\/pr_newswire_technology\/global-process-mining-software-market-size-value-estimated-to-reach-usd-11-096-7-million\/article_a95b3354-ec2f-5389-b761-e4dbbdadbb97.html#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20report%20published,forecast%20period%202022%20to%202030.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">according<\/a> to a report from Polaris Market Research.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292372\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t immediately clear whether the whole of the Minit team will join Microsoft &#8212; or, indeed, whether the company will remain spread across its current locations. (Minit is now headquartered in Amsterdam, with satellite offices in London and New York.) But CEO James Dening said that customers shouldn&#8217;t expect a change in the level of support they&#8217;re currently receiving.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are looking forward to what it means to become part of an industry leader like Microsoft and what that brings us &#8212; how we can use that scale and excellence to continue to deliver great solutions to our customers,&#8221; Dening wrote in a blog <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minit.io\/blog\/microsoft-minit-acquisition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post<\/a> on Minit&#8217;s website. &#8220;It has been a privilege to lead the company for the last year, and I\u2019m excited to continue my journey with the team, as part of what I consider to be the world\u2019s leading software company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, Microsoft spokesperson Zara Huang told TechCrunch that the Minit team will move into the\u00a0<span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> Process Insights team and that there will be &#8220;no change&#8221; to the current work location of Minit team members. <span class=\"il\">Microsoft<\/span> is in early stages of determining how Minit will be integrated into its offerings, she said, and the companies will share more details when they&#8217;re available.<\/p>\n<p>Minit, which was founded in 2015 by Rasto Hlavac and had raised \u20ac10.3 million (~$11.40 million) prior to the acquisition, is one of an expanding number of startups developing process mining tools aimed at enterprise clientele. Process mining, also known as task discovery, involves spotting root cause workflow issues and bottlenecks by pulling data from systems including desktop, email apps and workflows. It&#8217;s a key part of robotic process automation (RPA), a technology that promises to automate monotonous, repetitive tasks traditionally performed by human workers while at the same time generating logs to identify potential cost savings.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>As Protocol&#8217;s Aisha Counts <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/bulletins\/microsoft-process-mining-minit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">notes<\/a>, process mining has traditionally been done by system integrators who map out processes by analyzing manual workflows. Process mining software is designed to digitize the approach in a way that reduces the expense, time and effort involved.<\/p>\n<p>Underlining the appetite for process mining technologies, Celonis, a data processing company, earlier this week acquired Minit competitor Process Analytics Factory, which coincidentally integrates with Microsoft&#8217;s Power BI analytics platform. Just in the past several years, RPA vendor Automation Anywhere acquired process discovery and mining startups FortressIQ, Process Gold\\ and StepShot; Blue Prism released a task mining solution called Capture; and rivals including ABBYY and Kryon have expanded their process mining offerings.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/\">Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Celonis pushes into Microsoft ecosystem with $100M Process Analytics Factory acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/celonis-pushes-into-microsoft-ecosystem-with-100m-process-analytics-factory-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=wqSRCOP7wQ#?secret=2NKiKfcj0k\" data-secret=\"2NKiKfcj0k\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;You know the process space is hot when even Microsoft, with its vast resources, has to buy its way in.

SAP acquired German process automation company Signavio in January 2021, just before ServiceNow got into the RPA segment with the buyout of India-based Intellibot.io.

been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/20\/robotics-roundup-12\/\">focused on pizza<\/a>. I\u2019ve long posited that this is for two key reasons. First: People like pizza. We eat a lot of it. Americans alone eat three billion pizzas a year. Second: It\u2019s relatively easy to make. The dough provides a fairly straightforward platform onto which ingredients are added.<\/p>\n<p>I say \u201cfairly\u201d here because there are still complications. There\u2019s really no such thing as easy when it comes to building robots that can execute variations on a task at a large scale. Here it\u2019s the dough that presents the problem. Turning a soft and malleable ball of dough into a pizza crust is one of those things humans have figured out how to do efficiently, but it still proves difficult for robot workers.<\/p>\n<p>A team of researchers at MIT, CMU and UC San Diego set out to create what they\u2019ve deemed \u201ccomplex dough-manipulation.\u201d The system is separated into a two-step process, in which the robot must first determine the task and then execute it using a tool like a rolling pin. The system, <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2022\/robotic-deformable-object-0331\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DiffSkill<\/a>, involves teaching robots complex tasks in simulations.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292473\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>MIT notes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A \u201cteacher\u201d algorithm solves each step the robot must take to complete the task. Then, it trains a \u201cstudent\u201d machine-learning model that learns abstract ideas about when and how to execute each skill it needs during the task, like using a rolling pin. With this knowledge, the system reasons about how to execute the skills to complete the entire task.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The researchers say the system outperformed those trained in the more traditional reinforcement learning model. \u201cOur framework provides a novel way for robots to acquire new skills. These skills can then be chained to solve more complex tasks which are beyond the capability of previous robot systems,\u201d says CSAIL grad student, Yunzhu Li.<\/p>\n<p>This is robotics, so the whole pizza thing is really an initial problem for a system designed to tackle a lot more tasks. The company points to the emerging field of eldercare robotics as a possible use going forward.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A disproportionate number of the early industrial food-making robots we\u2019ve seen have been focused on pizza.

cyberattack blamed on Russian wiper malware"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The recent cyberattack on U.S. satellite communications provider Viasat, an incident that triggered satellite service outages across central and eastern Europe, was likely the result of destructive wiper malware, according to newly published security research.<\/p>\n<p>Details about the cyberattack, which rendered Viasat\u2019s KA-SAT network inoperable since February 24 \u2014 the day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine \u2014 have so far been light. The attack, which also disconnected remote access to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/business\/energy\/satellite-outage-knocks-out-control-enercon-wind-turbines-2022-02-28\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">about 5,800 wind turbines across Germany<\/a>, was originally believed to be the result of a distributed denial of service attack, but SentinelLabs researchers now believe it was the result of a new strain of wiper malware called \u201cAcidRain\u201d that was designed to remotely erase vulnerable modems and routers.<\/p>\n<p>AcidRain\u00a0was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sentinelone.com\/labs\/acidrain-a-modem-wiper-rains-down-on-europe\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">discovered by SentinelLabs researchers<\/a> on March 15 after it was uploaded to VirusTotal from a user in Italy with the name &#8220;ukrop,&#8221; which the researchers say could be shorthand for &#8220;Ukraine operation.&#8221; The wiper&#8217;s functionality is described as \u201cgeneric\u201d by the researchers, in that it performs an in-depth wipe of the filesystem and various known storage device files, before attempting to destroy the data. Once the wiping processes are complete, the device is rebooted and ultimately rendered inoperable.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292243\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cAcidRain\u2019s functionality is relatively straightforward and takes a bruteforce attempt that possibly signifies that the attackers were either unfamiliar with the particulars of the target firmware or wanted the tool to remain generic and reusable,\u201d said SentinelLabs researchers\u00a0Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade and Max van Amerongen.<\/p>\n<p>While the identity of the attackers remains unknown, SentinelLabs has noted similarities between AcidRain and the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/10\/04\/uk-says-russias-gru-was-behind-a-spate-of-chaotic-cyber-attacks-between-2015-and-2017\/\">VPNFilter malware<\/a>, which infected thousands of home and small business routers and network devices worldwide. In 2018, the FBI attributed the VPNFilter operation to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cybersecobservatory.com\/2018\/05\/29\/fbi-warns-russians-hacked-hundreds-thousands-routers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Russian-backed &#8220;Fancy Bear&#8221; \u2014 or APT28 \u2014 hacking group<\/a>, and more recently, the NSA and CISA tied it to Sandworm, which has been accused of a five-year spree of attacks, including the destructive <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/notpetya\/\">NotPetya<\/a> cyberattack that targeted hundreds of firms and hospitals worldwide and cyberattacks that took down part of the Ukrainian power grid. Both APT28 and Sandworm have been linked to Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, the GRU.<\/p>\n<p>The researchers note that while it \u201ccannot definitively\u201d tie AcidRain to VPNFilter, or the larger Sandworm threat cluster, it notes \u201ca medium-confidence assessment of non-trivial developmental similarities between their components.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>AcidRain is believed to be the seventh strain of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/28\/fbi-cisa-ukraine-wiper-malware\/\">wiper malware to target Ukraine<\/a> since the onset of Russia\u2019s invasion, the researcher said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Viasat confirmed much of SentinelOne&#8217;s findings in a statement given to TechCrunch. Viasaid said the researchers&#8217; findings are &#8220;consistent with the facts in our report,&#8221; which it released Wednesday, but declined to comment further citing an ongoing investigation.<\/p>\n<p>Viasat said on Wednesday in its first incident response report regarding the February cyberattack that the unnamed attackers exploited a misconfigured VPN appliance to gain remote access to the &#8220;trusted management&#8221; segment of the KA-SAT network, before using their access to \u201cexecute legitimate, targeted management commands on a large number of residential modems simultaneously.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Viasat goes on to add that \u201cthese destructive commands overwrote key data in flash memory on the modems, rendering the modems unable to access the network, but not permanently unusable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>SentineLabs notes in its report that it remains unclear how legitimate commands could have such a disruptive effect on the modems. \u201cDespite Viasat\u2019s statement claiming that there was no supply-chain attack or use of malicious code on the affected routers, we posit the more plausible hypothesis that the attackers deployed AcidRain (and perhaps other binaries and scripts) to these devices in order to conduct their operation,&#8221;\u00a0Guerrero-Saade and van Amerongen concluded.<\/p>\n<p>Since the February attack, which Viasat says impacted several thousand customers located in Ukraine and tens of thousands of customers across Europe, the company has shipped almost 30,000 modems to distributors to bring customers back online. The outage has not yet been fully resolved, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/18\/cisa-fbi-satellite-networks\/\">CISA and the FBI have warned that US satellites could be the next target<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Updated with comment from Viasat.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8yXTSaGoUF\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/18\/cisa-fbi-satellite-networks\/\">CISA, FBI warn of threats to US satellite networks after Viasat cyberattack<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;CISA, FBI warn of threats to US satellite networks after Viasat cyberattack&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/18\/cisa-fbi-satellite-networks\/embed\/#?secret=12P3BDhRrE#?secret=8yXTSaGoUF\" data-secret=\"8yXTSaGoUF\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The recent cyberattack on U.S. satellite communications provider Viasat, an incident that triggered satellite service outages across central and eastern Europe, was likely the result of destructive wiper malware, according to newly published security research.

Apple program puts device management, support in reach of SMBs"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Managing Apple devices can be a chore for small businesses &#8212; it takes time to set up each device, and it can be difficult to manage them in the field without being invasive, especially when it comes to &#8220;bring your own&#8221; devices.<\/p>\n<p>Last year, Apple <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/10\/apple-introduces-device-management-solution-aimed-at-small-business\/\">introduced a new program<\/a> in beta called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/business\/essentials\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Business Essentials<\/a> designed to help small businesses solve this issue, and today the company announced that it was now open for any legitimate small business to sign up in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>As Susan Prescott, Apple\u2019s vice president of enterprise and education marketing put it, small business owners aren&#8217;t IT pros and this gives them an easier way to manage Apple devices.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292192\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;As these businesses grow, so do the demands on their time. If you have more employees, you&#8217;re likely to have more devices. And that can mean time dealing with managing those devices, whether it&#8217;s set up, being lost, etc. So we felt like we were in a position to help by providing a really easy solution that helps small businesses stay focused on running their businesses,&#8221; Prescott said.<\/p>\n<p>The program includes a few components. For starters, it enables small businesses to easily enroll new devices, including installing a set of business applications. You can organize your setup with a base set of applications that every device in the company will get, and then you can refine that for each department or group with specific tools for each one, such as marketing, sales and so forth, or however you choose to organize them.<\/p>\n<p>Users access these apps via a Business Essentials app on their devices. They can have multiple devices and each has the same set of apps. When they double-click or tap the Business Essentials app, they go into a business desktop where they can access the apps assigned to them. Businesses also have the option of connecting to their single sign-on system, whatever that happens to be. This approach keeps personal data completely separate when employees are bringing their own devices while giving employees a familiar set of tools.<\/p>\n<p>Admins also have the option of forcing updates when desirable (like an essential security update) and can offer support for company or BYODs. The latter comes from an accompanying AppleCare+ for Business Essentials package. That includes 24\/7 access to Apple support and onsite repair in up to four hours, which is a pretty high-end service for small businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Each package that includes the service component comes with up to two repair credits, which companies can use to get service without having the employee or the customer swipe a credit card. What&#8217;s more, customers can pool these credits as they aren&#8217;t necessarily associated with the individual account. If the person leaves the company, however, repair credits get subtracted from the total.<\/p>\n<p>This level of device management is typically only available for much larger businesses. By giving smaller businesses access to this program, Apple is putting it within reach of SMBs, helping to free them up from IT administration chores, which are typically outside their areas of expertise, allowing them to concentrate more on other essential business tasks.<\/p>\n<p>Pricing is based on the number of devices and amount of storage, starting at $2.99 for one device with 50 GB of storage. If you want AppleCare+ along with a particular subscription type, that will cost you substantially more.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2292457\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2292457\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2292457\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-31-at-2.52.09-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Apple pricing\" width=\"680\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-31-at-2.52.09-PM.jpg 2246w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-31-at-2.52.09-PM.jpg?resize=150,71 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-31-at-2.52.09-PM.jpg?resize=300,142 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-31-at-2.52.09-PM.jpg?resize=768,365 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-31-at-2.52.09-PM.jpg?resize=680,323 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-31-at-2.52.09-PM.jpg?resize=1536,729 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-31-at-2.52.09-PM.jpg?resize=2048,972 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Screen-Shot-2022-03-31-at-2.52.09-PM.jpg?resize=50,24 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2292457\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Apple<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the device management component came at least in part from <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/24\/apple-has-acquired-fleetsmith-a-startup-that-helps-it-manage-apple-devices-remotely\/\">the Fleetsmith acquisition<\/a> in 2020.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Managing Apple devices can be a chore for small businesses &#8212; it takes time to set up each device, and it can be difficult to manage them in the field without being invasive, especially when it comes to &#8220;bring your own&#8221; devices.

transformative enterprise technologies.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">After winning the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/boston-meetup\/?_ga=2.63138347.584704528.1628113771-537177162.1628113771\">2013 TechCrunch Meetup and Pitch-off<\/a>, I decided to drop out of business school to pursue my <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/11\/15\/boston-pitch-off-winner-drop-lets-you-leave-surprise-messages-all-over-town\/\">startup<\/a> full time. Two years and two award-winning iPhone apps later, we ultimately decided it was time to sell our technology to Snapchat.<\/p>\n<p>At that point, I went back to Harvard to finish up my MBA, and after graduation, I joined an early-stage venture capital firm based in Palo Alto.<\/p>\n<p>Through my startup experience and having now invested in more than 10 startups with Wing, what I\u2019ve come to learn is that finding the right venture capitalist for your startup is one of the most important decisions you\u2019ll make. In many ways, it\u2019s like finding the right spouse.<\/p>\n<p>A great VC will do so much more for you than just write a check. You want someone with a high degree of empathy and curiosity who will ask the right questions and challenge you, while also being a shock absorber for bad news. VCs should never give armchair product advice nor cross the line into micromanagement.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tConsistent communication is important, but it\u2019s not just a matter of throwing a recurring meeting on the calendar.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>The best founder and VC relationships are based on trust and partnership; it should be a relationship that&#8217;s nonjudgmental, supportive, and constructive. As many founders can attest, the startup journey can be lonely at times. Having a true partner to help you steer the ship when the sailing is smooth or otherwise can be a game-changer.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some pieces of advice that I\u2019d give to founders about how to choose the right VC and get the best out of the relationship.<\/p>\n<h2>Choose someone who can help with your blind spots<\/h2>\n<p>As a founder, it\u2019s easy to get bogged down by details. In my case, I was so focused on the product experience that I didn\u2019t think through other strategic initiatives like marketing, partnerships, or, at times, fundraising.<\/p>\n<p>For example, it was only after being prompted by an investor that I started putting time and energy into strengthening my relationship with Apple to get our app featured in the Apple Store. This App Store feature changed the company\u2019s trajectory, and it came as a result of an investor making an introduction to Apple.<\/p>\n<p><div

First introduced to iPad users with iOS 13 then to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/22\/apple-unveils-ios-14-with-home-screen-widgets\/\">iPhone with iOS 14 in 2020<\/a>, YouTube has been slow to adopt this now standard functionality that allows users to stream videos in a small, floating miniplayer on their homescreen while multitasking on their device.<\/p>\n<p>To try out the new functionality with the YouTube TV streaming service, users first select a title they want to play then swipe up from the bottom of the screen to enable the picture-in-picture mode, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/YouTubeTV\/status\/1509262940708478981\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">explained in a tweet<\/a> announcing the news on Wednesday. YouTube said the feature was &#8220;slowly rolling out,&#8221; so not all users may see the option immediately.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">iPhone &amp; iPad users \ud83d\udd0a <\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292185\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>We\u2019re happy to share that picture-in-picture is now rolling out to your iOS 15+ devices.

There is some speculation that this delay has to do with how the YouTube player on iOS has been designed for serving and tracking ads &#8212; a core aspect of YouTube&#8217;s business and one which some other streamers &#8212; like Netflix and Amazon &#8212;\u00a0 wouldn&#8217;t have to contend with.<\/p>\n<p>This seems like a probable explanation, given that YouTube didn&#8217;t simply add the option for picture-in-picture (PiP) as other video apps have done, but rather <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/26\/youtube-to-roll-out-picture-in-picture-viewing-for-all-u-s-ios-users-starting-with-premium-subscribers\/\">has been &#8220;testing&#8221; the feature since last August<\/a> with Premium subscribers as part of its YouTube &#8220;experiments.&#8221; In 2020, YouTube had made opting into tests of upcoming features called &#8220;experiments&#8221; a perk for its Premium subscribers. Last year, YouTube began testing PiP on the iOS YouTube app with subscribers in the U.S. Now, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube&#8217;s experiments website<\/a>, those tests continue. On the site today, YouTube says the current test will be available until April 8.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Unfortunately, that test&#8217;s end date may not mean YouTube will add PiP support on iOS shortly thereafter.

security demands on SaaS companies are constantly increasing. Add users who need their data sandboxed from others or kept in a specific geographic region and the workload for development and security teams only increases. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.antimatter.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Antimatter<\/a>, which is coming out of stealth today and launching its service into private beta, offers a different kind of solution to these problems. It provides SaaS companies with the cryptographic infrastructure that can provably guarantee that a service meets their residency, governance and tenancy requirements, using secure enclaves that keeps data encrypted in transit, at rest and during execution.<\/p>\n<p>The company also today announced that it has raised a $12 million Series A round led by NEA, with participation from General Catalyst and UNION Labs. The founders of Snowflake, Okta, Dropbox, VMware, Segment and Databricks also participated in this round.<\/p>\n<p>The company was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.antimatter.io\/team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">co-founded<\/a> by Andrew Krioukov (CEO), the former founder and CEO of workplace management service <a href=\"https:\/\/comfyapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Comfy<\/a> (which Siemens acquired in 2018); Michael Andersen (CTO), the group&#8217;s cryptography specialist who, like Krioukov, has a PhD in Computer Science from Berkeley; and Beau Trincia (VP of Design), who was also on the founding team at Comfy and spent seven years working on user experience design and product at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ideo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IDEO<\/a>.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292152\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>During the experience of building Comfy, Krioukov and Trincia themselves faced the problem of having to protect the user data of large enterprise customers like Microsoft, BMW, Salesforce and SAP. &#8220;That was really hard,&#8221; said Krioukov. &#8220;It took a lot of engineering time. It took a lot of sales time to try to talk through all this. It delayed &#8212; and even killed &#8212; some sales for us.&#8221; After talking to Andersen, the team realized that they had the right ingredients to solve this problem once and for all, Krioukov explained.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, companies increasingly want more control over their data, even if it is under the auspice of a SaaS company, but it is very hard for SaaS companies to do that. &#8220;We realized we had a breakthrough and we could come up with a new solution that is a really different cloud deployment architecture that gives strong guarantees to the buyers and then allows the SaaS vendors to speed up their sales and offer cryptographic proof,&#8221; said Krioukov.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2292226\" style=\"width: 976px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/anitmatter_diagram.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2292226\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2292226\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/anitmatter_diagram.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"966\" height=\"668\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/anitmatter_diagram.jpg 966w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/anitmatter_diagram.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/anitmatter_diagram.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/anitmatter_diagram.jpg?resize=768,531 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/anitmatter_diagram.jpg?resize=680,470 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/anitmatter_diagram.jpg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 966px) 100vw, 966px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2292226\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Anitmatter<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>With Antimatter&#8217;s solution, the data sits in secure enclaves within Kubernetes and the company then uses that to give hardware guarantees that the data is always encrypted, even while being processed. &#8220;This gives SaaS vendors a way to prove that their customer data is secure &#8212; secure to a higher standard than anyone has ever really aimed for before because the app could be malicious, the employees could be malicious, all these things could go wrong &#8212; and the customer data would still be provably secure,&#8221; explained Andersen.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>He also noted that there is no performance impact when the SaaS application works with that private data inside the secure enclave. There is also no need to make code changes to the SaaS app. Antimatter&#8217;s service simply slots in underneath the app, as Andersen explained, and provides these guarantees because no unencrypted data can exit the enclave &#8212; and the hardware then guarantees that nobody can read the memory of the server either. All of the major clouds now offer some version of secure enclave thanks to the cryptographic features of modern server chips. Though as the team noted, that&#8217;s a great primitive to work from but doesn&#8217;t provide the kinds of guarantees Antimatter provides to its customers.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2292159\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2292159\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2292159 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Antimatter_gradient_background_rect0.4x.png?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Antimatter_gradient_background_rect0.4x.png 400w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Antimatter_gradient_background_rect0.4x.png?resize=150,75 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Antimatter_gradient_background_rect0.4x.png?resize=300,150 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Antimatter_gradient_background_rect0.4x.png?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2292159\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Antimatter<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth highlighting that with Beau Trincia, the team has a design-focused co-founder, something we don&#8217;t often see for these kinds of highly technical problems. But as Trincia noted, right from the outset, the team wanted to make sure it designed the right experiences for the services&#8217; target audiences. That may be the CTO who makes the final purchase decision but he also noted that the team wanted to build an intuitive user experience for the developers, as well as good user experience for those users inside a company that should (or shouldn&#8217;t) have access to this data. He also noted that part of the design challenge here is to show users that their data is indeed secure. &#8220;Being able to show people that events did or didn&#8217;t happen &#8212; and kind of really clearly explaining that and having an awesome dashboard for giving people that visibility [is important],&#8221; Trincia said.<\/p>\n<p>Like most companies at this stage, the team plans to use the new funding to expand the development team as it looks to open up its service to a wider audience soon.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe crypto tech and years of university R&amp;D that serve as Antimatter\u2019s foundation are a gigantic step forward for highly usable \u2014 yet provably correct \u2014 secure computing and data privacy,&#8221; said NEA venture partner Greg Papadopoulos. &#8220;We\u2019re super excited to partner with Andrew and the team as they empower companies to definitively secure customer computing and data.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With SaaS becoming the standard for most business software, the security demands on SaaS companies are constantly increasing.

right to repair legislation looms, Samsung introduces \u2018self-service\u2019 for Galaxy devices"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Last year, Apple proved it could still surprise when it announced a Self Service Repair plan. The offering is still limited, and the company &#8212; as ever &#8212; recommends users take their products in to get fixed, rather than potentially damaging them further. Even so, it marked a major shift for a company that has mostly frowned on <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/right-to-repair\/\">self-repair<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This morning, Samsung announced its own take on the category. The new program kicks off for Galaxy S20, S21 and Tab S7+ owners, offering tools, parts and guides to repair things like displays, back glass and charging ports. The company plans to continue adding additional phones to the lineup, going forward. My suspicion is we won\u2019t be seeing foldable display panels added to the list, due to their relative complexity, but time will tell.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, the news finds Samsung partnering with the teardown specialists at iFixit. It\u2019s not a dig at Apple exactly, though the iPhone maker has been dinged over repairability issues quiet a bit over the years. Though the site did credit Apple\u2019s decision last year, noting, \u201cApple is finally acknowledging that lots of us have the technical know-how to fix our own stuff.\u201d<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291768\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Per the Samsung deal, iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens notes, \u201cWe are excited to be consulting with Samsung to help them develop a solution for DIY parts and repair Information. Every time you fix a device, you\u2019re helping the planet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That last bit is, naturally, a big selling point in the press material surrounding this news. Samsung has been making a lot of noise around sustainability in recent years, including a reduction in packaging and utilizing more repurposed materials in its devices. Of course, the most surefire way to eliminate e-waste is simply building and buying fewer electronics. User-repairability &#8212; if done right &#8212; can extend the life of existing products.<\/p>\n<p>The big shadow looming over all of this is possible legislation being introduced both nationally and in state senates designed to give consumers more power. The implementation of these services can be seen &#8212; at least in part &#8212; as a proactive defense against potential legislation. Essentially something companies can point to as a way of showing that, actually, they\u2019re on the consumers\u2019 side with this one.<\/p>\n<p>The service is slated to arrive this summer.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last year, Apple proved it could still surprise when it announced a Self Service Repair plan.

Freestyle&#8217;s newest fund, the growth hack is staying the same"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Freestyle, a venture<\/span> capital firm that has cut early checks into companies such as Airtable, Patreon, BetterUp and Narvar, has closed its sixth fund at $130 million.<\/p>\n<p>The newest fund is also the firm\u2019s largest investment vehicle to date, but still feels tiny compared to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/27\/andreessen-horowitz-just-rolled-out-a-400-million-fund-thats-expressly-for-seed-deals\/\">Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s $400 million seed fund<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/greylock.com\/firm-news\/500m-for-seeds\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greylock\u2019s $500 million seed fund. <\/a>However, per general partner Jenny Lefcourt, the conservative raise was intentional: The growth hack, for the 2009-founded firm, is to stay the same despite valuation and check-size pressure from the broader early-stage market.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFund size ends up dictating strategy,\u201d Lefcourt said. If Freestyle raised a $500 million seed fund, Lefcourt explained, the firm would have to flip its model, hire associates and focus on investing in more founders versus working deeper with a select few. \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to raise a bigger fund when people want to give you money, but you could get addicted to management fees instead of carry.\u201d<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291710\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Indeed, Freestyle stands out for sticking to its original investment strategy, even with today\u2019s newly announced fund. The firm leads less than a dozen seed rounds per year, aims for 10% to 15% ownership and bets across all verticals. Freestyle has slightly grown its check size year over year to stay on a similar cadence, with its average bet between $1.5 million to $3 million. Despite web3 companies, which Lefcourt says they invest in despite ownership and valuation differences, Freestyle doesn\u2019t go for \u201cbuzzy companies\u201d with high valuations &#8212; which it considers above $20 million.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe both felt like we\u2019ve seen how this movie ends, and high valuations too early have actually caused trouble down the road for the vast majority of founders,\u201d said Lefcourt, who led the firm\u2019s investments in BetterUp, Narvar and Daily. \u201cWhile the quantity in deal flow has definitely gone up, the quality in aggregate is lower.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The firm does boast one (unfortunately) contrarian characteristic, though: ownership is split half and half between partners Jenny Lefcourt and Dave Samuel. Despite the steady rise of female check-writers, Lefcourt pointed out that within institutional firms, the title &#8220;partner&#8221; doesn\u2019t always come with true ownership or decision-making capabilities. About 43% of portfolio companies have a historically under-represented founder and co-founder, which Freestyle defines as non-white males and women of any race and ethnicity. About 29% of current fund companies have a woman founder and\/or co-founder.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2291725\" style=\"width: 857px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2291725\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2291725\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Dave_Jenny_HiRes-Yellow.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"847\" height=\"984\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Dave_Jenny_HiRes-Yellow.png 3273w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Dave_Jenny_HiRes-Yellow.png?resize=129,150 129w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Dave_Jenny_HiRes-Yellow.png?resize=258,300 258w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Dave_Jenny_HiRes-Yellow.png?resize=768,893 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Dave_Jenny_HiRes-Yellow.png?resize=585,680 585w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Dave_Jenny_HiRes-Yellow.png?resize=1321,1536 1321w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Dave_Jenny_HiRes-Yellow.png?resize=1762,2048 1762w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Dave_Jenny_HiRes-Yellow.png?resize=43,50 43w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 847px) 100vw, 847px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2291725\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Jenny Lefcourt and Dave Samuel, the general partners of Freestyle. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Freestyle<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Last year, the firm\u2019s co-founder Josh Felser left to start another venture capital firm, this time with an explicit focus on<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/06\/climactic-raj-kapoor-josh-felser\/\"> startups tackling climate change<\/a>.

Today&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2022\/03\/introducing-new-instagram-messaging-features\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">changes<\/a> include the following:<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292099\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Music sharing:<\/strong> Instagram will integrate with Apple Music, Amazon Music and, soon, Spotify, to allow users to share 30-second song previews in chats.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reply while browsing:<\/strong> The app will allow you to reply to new messages while browsing their Feed, without having to go to the inbox and lose your place.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Quick sending:<\/strong> You can now tap and hold the share button to quickly reshare posts to your closest four friends.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Status:<\/strong> At the top of your inbox, you can now see who&#8217;s free to chat with, similar to Messenger.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Silent messages:<\/strong> You can opt to send messages to friends without bothering them &#8212; like when you know they&#8217;re busy or asleep.

As part of this upgrade, Instagram&#8217;s inbox received several more features, including the ability to change the chat color, react with emojis, co-watch videos and more. The company confirmed to us that only music sharing, the new chat theme and the quick-send features will work if users haven&#8217;t yet opted-in to the upgraded messaging experience.<\/p>\n<p>The DM update follows Instagram&#8217;s decision to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/17\/instagram-will-shut-down-its-companion-app-threads-by-year-end\/\">close down its companion messaging app<\/a> called Threads in December 2021. The company said at the time it planned to bring Threads&#8217; unique features to the main Instagram app in the future. Instagram also explained that consolidating its efforts around messaging in one app made more sense, in terms of time and resources.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram included messaging as a key area of focus for 2022, alongside other priorities, like video, controls and creator monetization efforts. In the same update where Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/6\/30\/22557942\/instagram-no-longer-photo-app-video-entertainment-focus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proclaimed<\/a> in December that Instagram was &#8220;no longer a photo-sharing app,&#8221; he also spoke about the company&#8217;s plans for private communications. Messaging is &#8220;the primary way people connect online at this point,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We think Instagram can be the best place for people to connect with their friends about their interests, and Instagram is to embrace the fact that messaging is that primary form of communication,&#8221; Mosseri explained.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The Instagram inbox isn&#8217;t the only Meta-owned messaging product being upgraded this week. Just yesterday, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/messenger-shortcuts-everyone-feature\/\">Messenger introduced Slack-like &#8220;@everyone&#8221; functionality<\/a> that will notify all participants in a chat about a new message, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/29\/messenger-shortcuts-everyone-feature\/\">and other shortcuts<\/a> like a &#8220;\/silent&#8221; feature, similar to Instagram&#8217;s &#8220;@silent,&#8221; and more. WhatsApp, meanwhile, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/30\/people-are-sending-7-billion-voice-messages-on-whatsapp-every-day\/\">upgraded its voice message functionality<\/a> with several new features yesterday, as well.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram says its new DM features will be available in select countries at launch, but will expand globally in time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Instagram today is rolling out over a half dozen new messaging features, following promises late last year that its DM (direct message) inbox would get a significant upgrade in 2022.

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Docker<\/a> looked like it was on the ropes. In 2019, it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/13\/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise\/\">sold its enterprise business<\/a> and decided to focus strictly <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/10\/docker-regroups-as-cloud-native-developer-tool-company\/\">on a developer audience<\/a> with a set of commercial and open source tools. It was a pretty big bet for a six-year-old company to sell off the part of itself that was most lucrative at the time and completely shift its focus.<\/p>\n<p>A couple of months ago, the company announced that annual recurring revenue (ARR) <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/01\/docker-makes-comeback-reaching-over-50m-in-arr\/\">had jumped 4x to over $50 million<\/a> just two years after it decided to restructure. Today, the company announced a $105 million Series C investment on a $2.1 billion valuation.<\/p>\n<p>CEO Scott Johnston, who has been with the company for years in various capacities, made a very clear bet on the developer community, and it is paying off handsomely for him as he has been able to shape a successful business model since the restructuring.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2292052\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Two and a half years ago, while we had this product that developers loved; while we had popular upstream open source assets and we had a known brand, it wasn&#8217;t clear whether we could take all of that and redo the product strategy we needed to go to market, redo the company business model successfully &#8212; all of that was an open question,&#8221; Johnston said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re happy that here we are two and a half years later. We didn&#8217;t make perfect decisions or perfect bets all the time, but most of our bets have paid off and are serving developers with the products we&#8217;re shipping,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, in a time when investment appears to be slowing down, Johnston reports that investors came to him, he had a wealth of opportunity and could have gotten more if he wanted it. &#8220;It was unsolicited, and we had choice. We had multiple term sheets that were all competitive. And we could have raised more than 105 that we raised. And so we&#8217;re very fortunate to be able to choose.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He believes that in addition to being a known quantity with an open source component that is popular with developers, the potential market for developer tools is massive, especially as the demand for applications continues to grow. He said the combination of those two factors drove the investor interest in this round.<\/p>\n<p>The company shrank to 70 people when it restructured in 2019. Today it is up to over 150 employees with expectations that number will double in the next year. As the company adds headcount, Johnston said that they have hard metrics related to building a diverse workforce.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So we have an internal KPI, key performance indicator, that&#8217;s quantified in terms of diversity. And we have it at the company level, but then each of the managers, the executives for their functions, are on that as well. And again, to put teeth on it, that&#8217;s a number that we had to share with the board as well,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>He said that they look at this on a weekly basis. &#8220;We have a weekly roll-up of our progress in our hiring and recruiting funnel and there&#8217;s an explicit diversity metric in that weekly recruiting. And so, you know, it goes back to the why, right? And that&#8217;s because diverse teams are better teams. It&#8217;s better not only from a human standpoint, but it&#8217;s better frankly from a capitalist performance standpoint. So we deeply believe that and to execute that belief, we hold ourselves accountable numerically,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s investment was led by new investor Bain Capital Ventures with participation from Atlassian Ventures, Citi Ventures, Vertex Ventures and Four Rivers, along with existing investors Benchmark Capital, Insight Partners and Tribe Capital. The company has raised $163 million in its current guise on that $2.1 billion valuation. Bain&#8217;s Enrique Salem will be joining the Docker board under the terms of the agreement.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"BmZudcn4je\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/01\/docker-makes-comeback-reaching-over-50m-in-arr\/\">Docker makes comeback with over $50M in ARR two years into restructuring<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Docker makes comeback with over $50M in ARR two years into restructuring&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/01\/docker-makes-comeback-reaching-over-50m-in-arr\/embed\/#?secret=fEAJyWrLtt#?secret=BmZudcn4je\" data-secret=\"BmZudcn4je\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It wasn&#8217;t that long ago that Docker looked like it was on the ropes.

to direct users to trusted sources, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/news\/fact-checking-misinformation-google-features\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> on Thursday. The new label, which will appear in the Top Stories carousel, is designed to help users identify stories that have been frequently cited by other news organizations. The highly cited label is launching soon on mobile in the United States and will roll out globally in the coming weeks.<\/p>\n<p>The label will be placed on investigative articles, interviews, announcements, press releases, local news stories and more. Google says it&#8217;s particularly interested in how the label can be used to elevate original reporting.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Let\u2019s say a local news organization breaks an investigative story looking into problems at your local school district,&#8221; the company said in a blog post. &#8220;The story is so big that it gets picked up by numerous other media outlets. But what if you didn\u2019t see that original story, which had unique context for local residents?

So it&#8217;s likely that even as startups trim staff, the labor market for tech workers remains more than temperate.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/?tpcc=theexchange\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-2220368 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg 900w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>But cutting headcount is a quick way to cut burn and extend runway. If cash is business oxygen, laying staff off lets a company breathe more slowly, extending its life expectancy without an infusion of external capital (air).<\/p>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem likely that we&#8217;re on the precipice of a similar spike in layoffs that the onset of COVID-19 brought in 2020. That moment is essentially impossible to reconstitute in business terms. This time around, folks better know what is coming. Changing public market valuations for tech companies and a frozen IPO market have soured private-market sentiment concerning high-growth, high-burn startups. But the damage will accrete more slowly, as startups are each on a different cash countdown, meaning that their respective hard choices about staffing levels won&#8217;t occur at once.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a quick moment to consider the latest state of the Fast saga, skate through recent startup layoffs to see if we can spy a trend, and ask what we&#8217;re going to see in Q2.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Startups are once again considering layoffs as a way to control cash consumption and attract new capital.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":428363,"featured_media":1996006,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"2b5881bf-e00e-351e-b7ec-0b50f819cf9e"},"categories":[60523764,20429,17396],"tags":[291,700675,576848161,576846311,576847237,23242,637,576765839,202],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796353,576796356],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3_GRY.jpg","parsely":{"version":"1.0.0","meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"NewsArticle","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/31\/is-it-time-to-start-worrying-about-startup-layoffs\/"},"headline":"Is it time to start worrying about startup layoffs?","url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/31\/is-it-time-to-start-worrying-about-startup-layoffs\/","thumbnailUrl":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3_GRY.jpg?w=150","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3_GRY.jpg?w=150"},"dateCreated":"2022-03-31T13:49:10Z","datePublished":"2022-03-31T13:49:10Z","dateModified":"2022-03-31T13:49:10Z","articleSection":"post","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Alex Wilhelm"}],"creator":["Alex Wilhelm"],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TechCrunch","logo":{"@type":"imageObject","url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/themes\/techcrunch-2017\/images\/logo-json-ld.png","width":"600","height":"60"}},"keywords":["@post-id:2292058","fundings &amp;

cost in the millions of dollars. Rental is often the name of the game, but the latticework of mom-and-pop equipment rentals can be hard to navigate. <a href=\"https:\/\/tryboxedup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BoxedUp<\/a> takes a fresh look at the space, creating a rental marketplace &#8212; a Turo or Airbnb for video equipment if you will &#8212; where equipment owners can offer up their gear for rent.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s model works by aggregating listings from individual owners, local rental shops and manufacturers, giving content creators access to equipment, and owners a national platform to earn money on gear. For now, the company focuses on the U.S. only, but the investment will enable an upgrade of fulfillment capabilities, enabling BoxedUp to offer same-day delivery in key markets.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith this funding, BoxedUp can focus on expanding the capabilities of our platform, enabling us to better serve our customers, brands and local rental shops throughout the United States,\u201d Donald Boone, CEO and founder at BoxedUp, said of the funding round. The company recently closed $2.3 million, with money from Slauson &amp; Co., Collab Capital, Black Capital and Outlander VC. \u201cWe plan to build on this opportunity and grow our team, bringing on additional engineering talent and operational expertise.\u201d<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2290282\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The BoxedUp team is perfectly positioned to meet content creators where they are without the burden of equipment ownership and logistics while providing equipment owners a way to easily monetize their underutilized inventory,\u201d Ajay Relan, managing partner at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slauson.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Slauson &amp; Co.<\/a>, explains the thinking behind the investment. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited for this intersection of the creator and shared economies and looking forward to supporting the vision and expansion of the platform.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company originally started as a rental company focusing on camera kits aimed at video conferences, virtual events and similar use cases.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We were reacting quickly to many customer issues. The pandemic was on Full Tilt, and mainstream media really struggled with this idea that all of our talent is now absolutely dispersed throughout the world. And oh, by the way, they have really shitty cameras,&#8221; explains Boone. &#8220;I tested out a couple of camera kits, and it was looking great. A friend recommended that I should start pitching these kits to mainstream media outlets. The first company we sold to was <a href=\"https:\/\/blavity.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Blavity<\/a>. And then we picked up NPR and Amazon and Google and then the ball just got rolling really quickly.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>BoxedUp had stumbled into a market where the traditional players weren&#8217;t serving the customer need; high-end Hollywood productions have their own systems for renting equipment, but for the vastly sized long-tail of small and medium-sized creators, there was nothing with the ease of use that the rest of the internet has gotten used to. Once the company had a little bit of traction, things started snowballing.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"LjGHJkwZPZ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/09\/how-to-calculate-your-startups-tam-sam-and-som\/\">How to calculate your startup&#8217;s TAM, SAM and SOM<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How to calculate your startup&#8217;s TAM, SAM and SOM&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/09\/how-to-calculate-your-startups-tam-sam-and-som\/embed\/#?secret=XE0n2eXlZu#?secret=LjGHJkwZPZ\" data-secret=\"LjGHJkwZPZ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Do you guys do documentary work? Do you have anything to make renting equipment for documentaries easier,&#8221; Boone recalls the questions started coming in. &#8220;We got to thinking &#8216;I wonder how this experience looks like if you&#8217;re shooting a movie or a music video,&#8217; and we came to find out it&#8217;s actually pretty miserable. At the moment it&#8217;s all email transactions. A cinematographer or videographer writes something in the notes app of their iPhone, and sends it to a rental shop. Sometimes they&#8217;re DMing people.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Building a marketplace to make these types of rentals easier was the obvious next step.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We found a <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">$10 billion opportunity where owner-operators are renting things out via Instagram and rental shops are still using really old websites,&#8221; says Boone. &#8220;We think that there was an opportunity for us to be the technology platform, the marketplace. The equipment owners don&#8217;t want to deal with the tech &#8212; they&#8217;re artists at the end of the day.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In the early days, the company stocked its own equipment, and it would work with manufacturers, who would send them their open-box or cosmetically damaged items. The company would rent out on their behalf. Of course, high-end equipment is expensive, and the company decided it would make more sense to utilize the equipment that sits unused most of the time, connecting it with creators that need access to high-end video equipment.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Instead of spending $30,000 to buy a camera to rent out one at a time, we could instead create the platform to connect people that <em>have<\/em> that $30,000 camera. So we&#8217;ve sort of shifted real-time and during COVID we owned everything, but right now our entire go-to-market is 100% empowering the local mom-and-pop rental shops and the individual owner-operators,&#8221; says Boone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The cameras, lenses and lighting equipment to shoot even a relatively modest production can cost in the millions of dollars.

Aerospace has been awarded a $25.2 million, 39-month contract by the U.S. Space Force (USSF) to further develop and deliver two of its products: Digital Space Twin and Slingshot Laboratory. The contract was funded by Space Systems Command and the USSF\u2019s venture branch, SpaceWERX.<\/p>\n<p>Digital Space Twin is a virtual environment that not only provides a realistic simulation of the physics at play in orbit, but also reflects what\u2019s going on in space in real time, using multiple data sources to map the current location of bodies in orbit (satellites and space junk) and account for space weather. The program can be used to simulate missions as well as plan for future satellite constellations \u2014 something beneficial for governmental and commercial entities alike.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was important to us since the very beginning to create products that work for both government and commercial use,\u201d Melanie Stricklan, Slingshot Aerospace\u2019s co-founder and CEO tells TechCrunch. \u201cIt will take a collective effort across all commercial, government and civil organizations to ensure that space remains a tenet of our global economy for generations to come, which is why our products have gained traction in both sectors.\u201d<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291651\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>For defense agencies, in particular, Digital Space Twin can also be used for war games. (Ender\u2019s Game, anyone?) Per a press release, \u201cthe USSF will use Slingshot Aerospace\u2019s Digital Space Twin to visualize potential nefarious acts that could occur in orbit. By being apprised of and understanding the impact of current threats, users can employ known data to plan and simulate responses and predict future adversary behavior in order to maintain national security.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Slingshot Laboratory, on the other hand, is a training program with virtual environments that reflect astrodynamics and astronautics \u2014 essentially it\u2019s a physics-driven sandbox game to help students conceptualize the space environment in an immersive, interactive way. The USSF plans to run pilot programs at Basic Military Training (BMT), the National Security Space Institute (NSSI), the 319th Combat Training Squadron and the 533rd Training Squadron.<\/p>\n<p>Before the USSF\u2019s investment, Slingshot Aerospace\u2019s primary product was Slingshot Beacon, a satellite collision avoidance program whose clients will comprise 63% of all satellite constellations in low Earth orbit by the end of 2022. The program <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/10\/slingshot-aerospace-raises-25m-to-help-satellite-operators-navigate-space-traffic\/\">recently raised $34.6 million<\/a> over a two-part Series A round, but it does face competition from companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/03\/leolabs-raises-65m-series-b-for-its-satellite-monitoring-and-collision-detection-service\/\">LeoLabs<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/13\/kayhan-space-wants-to-be-the-air-traffic-control-service-for-satellites-in-space\/\">Kayhan Space<\/a>. But Slingshot\u2019s priorities may be shifting with the new contract.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSlingshot\u2019s Digital Space Twin is quickly gaining fidelity with the large investments our company has privately made towards the product in addition to the investments we have received from the government,\u201d says Stricklan. \u201cOur Digital Space Twin is on track to soon become our flagship product due to the clear value it has for a vast array of customers across the industry including spacecraft owner-operators, launch operators, manufacturers, insurers, and future space-related product developers.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s a classic case of where the money goes, innovation will follow.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Space simulation and analytics company Slingshot Aerospace has been awarded a $25.2 million, 39-month contract by the U.S. Space Force (USSF) to further develop and deliver two of its products: Digital Space Twin and Slingshot Laboratory.

Despite that opportunity, they thought freelancers still lacked access to financial services and were at the mercy of companies treating them like vendors and paying them in 30 days or longer for completed work.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are on a mission to \u2018unfuck\u2019 the freelance economy,\u201d she told TechCrunch. Aaron estimates that Archie is saving its customers hours of time that they can now use to focus on growth-related opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Their approach is catching on. Since last April, Archie is seeing $15 million in payment volume run-rate, up eight times since July 2021 alone. In addition, their growth is driven in large part by word of mouth \u2014 freelancers taking Archie with them to new employers as their preferred method of doing business with clients.<\/p>\n<p>The new funding enables the company to boost its engineering team and technology development as it starts to amp up its efforts on the growth side, Reguero said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Their plan going forward includes leveraging its structured knowledge about payments to underwrite products and build additional financial services for freelancers, including banking, savings, credit and income verification.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe will continue to focus on growth, building out different layers of the platform,\u201d Reguero added. \u201cThat includes providing ways for contracts and other forms to get signed before someone comes on, as well as investing in international payments so businesses have the ability to pay contractors in other countries. Ultimately, we want to make this as seamless as possible.\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"D4E0Ferbgh\"><p><a

American startups in recent history &#8212; the company became Uruguay&#8217;s first unicorn in 2020 and went public on the Nasdaq in 2021. DLocal&#8217;s founders had first launched AstroPay, another digital payments platform that now has over five million users.<\/p>\n<p>Now, dLocal and AstroPay co-founder Sergio Fogel has teamed up with AstroPay&#8217;s former head of product, Gonzalo Strauss, to launch another fintech out of Montevideo, Uruguay, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.datanomik.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Datanomik<\/a>. Datanomik&#8217;s goal is to connect financial institutions across LatAm through its B2B open finance API, which gathers a company&#8217;s banking information on one platform, Strauss told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>Strauss dreamed up the idea for Datanomik as a solution to some of the pain points he had faced working at AstroPay processing payments in emerging markets.<\/p><div id=\"tc-target-mid-article-2291741\" class=\"tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto\"><\/div>\n<p>Cash is still the primary payment method of choice in emerging markets, which posed challenges to fintech companies like AstroPay in reconciling their payments to understand their bank account balances and cash flow, according to Strauss.<\/p>\n<p>Different banks all have their own reporting interfaces and platforms that customers can access, and many don&#8217;t give customers APIs to be able to access their own data. When banks do provide APIs to customers, they often come in different formats, from PDFs to CSVs, so as a company with multiple bank accounts, it&#8217;s a tedious process to log into each different account and gather information in order to gain a consolidated view of the company&#8217;s financial position, he added.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2291804\" style=\"width: 378px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2291804\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-2291804\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Datanomik_techcrunch.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Datanomik co-founders Sergio Fogel and Gonzalo Strauss\" width=\"368\" height=\"239\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Datanomik_techcrunch.jpg 2000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Datanomik_techcrunch.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Datanomik_techcrunch.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Datanomik_techcrunch.jpg?resize=768,499 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Datanomik_techcrunch.jpg?resize=680,442 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Datanomik_techcrunch.jpg?resize=1536,998 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Datanomik_techcrunch.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2291804\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Datanomik co-founders Sergio Fogel and Gonzalo Strauss. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Datanomik<\/em><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There was no easy way of interacting with our bank accounts. Basically what we were doing was manually entering our own bank [information] every five to 10 minutes to get all of transactions, to get our balances, to get all of our different bank accounts and reconcile the payments, get support and reconciliation, and more &#8230; I decided this was not a scalable solution,&#8221; Strauss said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The open banking system seemed promising to Strauss as a potential solution that could help companies like AstroPay automate their processes and receive more streamlined banking information. Open banking seeks to bypass traditional financial rails by allowing banks to give developers access to their data through APIs. The technology has taken off with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/20\/truelayer-nabs-130m-at-a-1b-valuation-as-open-banking-rises-as-a-viable-option-to-card-networks\/\">startups like TrueLayer in the U.K.<\/a>, where regulators were early to greenlight open banking solutions, and Plaid in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>But when Strauss searched for a solution in LatAm that would fit the needs of businesses in the region, he came up empty &#8212; so he decided to build it himself. His work started out as an internal project within AstroPay, but after developing the idea, Strauss approached Fogel, his manager at the time, and pitched him on launching the project as a standalone company.<\/p>\n<p>Fogel was impressed by Strauss&#8217;s pitch and ended up gauging interest from some of his investor contacts, including fintech-focused partner Angela Strange at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Strauss&#8217;s venture didn&#8217;t have an official name yet &#8212; all he had was the product itself and the pitch he had delivered to Fogel &#8212; but that was enough to pique the interest of Strange and her team.<\/p>\n<p>Fast-forward three months to today, and Datanomik, Strauss&#8217;s venture, announced it has raised a $6 million seed round led by a16z. LatAm-focused venture firms Canary, Nazca and Latitud also participated in the round, alongside prominent angel investors from other tech startups and banks.<\/p>\n<p>The financing marks a16z&#8217;s first investment in Uruguay, and one of its biggest seed rounds in Latin America.<\/p>\n<p>Datanomik has five customers today, though Strauss did not name specific ones. The company says its goal is to help companies like dLocal or <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/03\/22\/fintech-startup-jeeves-raises-180m-quadruples-valuation-to-2-1b\/\">corporate expense management platform Jeeves<\/a>, which rely on analyzing companies&#8217; bank statements to do business.<\/p>\n<p>Although it is headquartered in Uruguay, Strauss said Datanomik&#8217;s main target market is Brazil, both because of its larger population size and because the country&#8217;s central bank and regulators are in their final phase of adopting an open banking framework. He added that Datanomik also has its sights set on Mexico and Colombia, which are both in the process of adopting an open banking system as well, though they are in earlier stages than Brazil. Eventually, Strauss hopes to expand the product across the LatAm region to businesses in Uruguay, Peru, Argentina and other countries that face similar challenges.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you have a company that has subsidiaries in, let&#8217;s say, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, and the CFO wants to know, how much money do I have in my bank accounts, through Datanomik you will be able to, through one API, get a unified picture of all of these accounts,&#8221; Strauss said.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cross-border payments platform dLocal is one of the most notable Latin American startups in recent history &#8212; the company became Uruguay&#8217;s first unicorn in 2020 and went public on the Nasdaq in 2021.

Brown is CEO and founder of Impossible Foods, a company at the forefront of making nutritious, delicious meat and dairy products from plants to satisfy meat lovers and address the environmental impact of animal farming.<\/p>\n\n<p>The idea for Impossible Foods came to Pat while he was on sabbatical from his position as an HHMI investigator and professor of biochemistry at the Stanford University School of Medicine. In reflecting on how he could use his training and experience to make the largest positive impact on the world, he realized there was a way to make delicious, affordable meat and dairy products, directly from plants \u2013 that would be better for the environment and for consumers. In 2011, Pat chose to devote himself full time to Impossible Foods.<\/p>\n\n<p>After receiving his BA, MD and PhD (in Biochemistry) at the University of Chicago, Pat completed a residency in pediatrics at Chicago\u2019s Children\u2019s Memorial Hospital. As a fellow with Mike Bishop and Harold Varmus, he defined the mechanism by which HIV and other retroviruses incorporate their genes into the genomes of the cells they infect.<\/p>\n\n<p>At Stanford, Pat and colleagues developed DNA microarrays \u2013 a new technology that made it possible to monitor the activity of all the genes in a genome \u2013 along with the first methods for analyzing, visualizing and interpreting global gene expression programs.<\/p>\n\n<p>He pioneered the use of gene expression patterns to classify cancers and improve prediction of their clinical course. He has also been a leader in making scientific and medical research results freely available to scientists, physicians and the public.

I love working in support of the incredible entrepreneurs who make this happen, defying all reasonable expectations to create a new reality from unique insight and vision. Before joining defy, I spent more than 6 years scaling Eventbrite from a startup into the world\u2019s largest event technology platform and marketplace for live experiences. As Eventbrite\u2019s first VP of Growth, CMO and VP\/GM of the company\u2019s largest revenue segment, I helped to scale the business from a small startup to millions of users, $300M in revenue, and through our IPO (NYSE: EB) with a nearly $3B market cap.
