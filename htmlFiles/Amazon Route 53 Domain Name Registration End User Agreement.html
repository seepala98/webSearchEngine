           <p><b>1.1</b> The terms of this Agreement apply to your use of the Domain Name Registration Services. Your use of the Domain Name Registration Services is also governed by the AWS Customer Agreement (or other agreement with AWS governing your use of the Domain Name Registration Services). In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of those other agreements, the terms of this Agreement will apply with respect to your use of the Domain Name Registration Services, but only to the extent of such conflict.</p> 
           <p><b>1.2 </b>You have access to ICANN’s <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/educational-2012-02-25-en" target="_blank">Registrant Educational Materials</a> and have certain rights and responsibilities, all of which are set out in the <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/benefits-2013-09-16-en" target="_blank">ICANN Registrants’ Benefits and Responsibilities</a> policy.</p> 
           <p><b>1.3</b> Updates During the Term. Your continued use of the Domain Name Registration Services will constitute acceptance of any additional or updated terms that become effective after you have accepted this Agreement and registered the Registered Name. Even if you register a Registered Name for an extended duration, or continue renewing your use of the Domain Name Registration Services through Automatic Renewal pursuant to Section 7.2 of this Agreement, you are responsible for monitoring and ensuring your compliance with any updated terms for your use of the Domain Name Registration Services.<br> </p>

          <div class="lb-rtxt"> 
           <p><b>2.1</b> AWS provides the Domain Name Registration Services through ICANN-accredited registrars. AWS currently provides Domain Name Registration Services through <a href="https://www.gandi.net/contracts" target="_blank">Gandi SAS</a> , <a href="https://www.domainbox.com/terms/">Mesh Digital Limited</a>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53/amazon-registrar-policies/" target="_blank">Amazon Registrar, Inc</a>., and other ICANN-accredited registrars (the “Registrar”), and your use of the Domain Name Registration Services is subject to their terms. You can identify the Registrar of record for any Registered Name by performing a WHOIS query&nbsp;<a href="https://registrar.amazon.com/whois" target="_blank">here</a> . AWS reserves the right to use any ICANN-accredited registrar as the Registrar.</p> 
           <p><b>2.2</b> Both AWS and the Registrar are required to comply with terms specified by (a) ICANN and (b) the Registry Operator for each specific gTLD or ccTLD. AWS may modify this Agreement in order to comply with the requirements of ICANN, the Registrar, or a Registry Operator. You agree that you will comply with all applicable Specifications and Policies. Should you refuse to accept any changes that are required by ICANN, the Registrar, or a Registry Operator, or any applicable Specifications and Policies, your domain name will be cancelled and no refund will be due to you.</p> 
           <p><b>2.2.1</b> AWS does not guarantee that it will be able to register or renew an applied-for domain name, even if the domain name may be labeled as available. No domain name registration request submitted to AWS will be deemed effective unless and until the relevant Registry Operator accepts the application and activates the applied-for domain name or renewal.</p> 
           <p><b>2.2.2 </b>AWS may reject an application to register or renew a domain name for any reason, including rejection due to non-compliance with the requirements of ICANN, the Registrar, or a Registry Operator.</p> 
           <p><b>2.3</b> You will comply with specific requirements related to the relevant gTLD or ccTLD, as required by or on behalf of AWS, the Registrar, ICANN, or the Registry Operator. The specific requirements related to each gTLD or ccTLD are available from the Registrar (located on the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/amazon-registrar-policies/" target="_blank">Amazon Registrar policy page</a>, the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/amazon-registrar-policies/" target="_blank">Gandi contract page</a> , the <a href="https://www.domainbox.com/terms/">Mesh Digital contract page</a> or the policy page of any other Registrar AWS may use.) Should you refuse to accept any requirements related to the relevant TLD, your domain name will be cancelled and no refund will be due to you.</p> 
           <p><b>2.4</b> You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless AWS, the Registrar, and the Registry Operator, and each of their affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents, from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) arising out of or related to your registration or use of the Registered Name.<br> </p>

          <h4 id="3._Registered_Names." class="lb-txt-none lb-h4 lb-title"> 3. Registered Names.</h4> 
          <div class="lb-rtxt"> 
           <p><b>3.1</b> For each Registered Name registered by you, the following terms, as well as any other terms set forth in an applicable Specification or Policy, will apply to you so long as you remain the Registered Name Holder for the Registered Name and will also apply to any other person or entity who is the Registered Name Holder. If you are not the Registered Name Holder for any Registered Name, then you represent and warrant that you are the designated agent for such Registered Name Holder and that the Registered Name Holder has either agreed to the terms of this Agreement or has granted you the necessary authority to agree to this Agreement on its behalf.</p> 
           <p><b>3.1.1</b> You will be identified as the Registered Name Holder in publicly-accessible WHOIS records, unless you use a Private Domain Registration or a Proxy Domain Registration.</p> 
           <p><b>3.1.2</b> For some gTLDs and ccTLDs, the Registry Operator considers the Registered Name Holder to have only an exclusive user license for use of the Registered Name; this does not change your obligations as the Registered Name Holder.</p> 
           <p><b>3.2</b> Per ICANN contractual requirements and other Specifications and Policies, you are required to provide to AWS accurate and reliable contact information, and to correct and update such information within seven days of any change during the term of the Registered Name registration, for each Registered Name. The required contact information includes the following Registration Data:</p> 
           <p><b>3.2.1</b> If the Registered Name Holder is an individual: the full legal name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and (where available) the fax number of the Registered Name Holder;</p> 
           <p><b>3.2.2</b> If the Registered Name Holder is an organization, association, or corporation: the full legal organization name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and (where available) the fax number of the Registered Name Holder</p> 
           <p><b>3.2.3</b> The names of the primary and secondary nameserver(s) for the Registered Name.</p> 
           <p><b>3.3</b> You will have the option of providing unique contact information for the Registered Name’s administrative and technical contacts. If you do not provide this contact information, the contact information you entered for the Registered Name Holder will be listed in these fields by default. You may update these fields at any time.</p> 
           <p><b>3.4 </b>In order to provide you with services under this Agreement, AWS and/or the Registrar is obligated to provide Registration Data to the Registry Operator for the relevant gTLD or ccTLD.</p> 
           <p><b>3.5</b>&nbsp;For gTLDs, the Registrar is required by ICANN to validate and verify certain Registration Data in connection with the initial registration of the Registered Name and periodically thereafter. Some ccTLDs may have similar Specifications and Policies. The Registrar or Registry Operator may contact you in connection with the validation and verification of Registration Data associated with your Registered Name, and your timely and accurate response to Registration Data inquiries is necessary to maintain your registration of the Registered Name. Your willful provision of inaccurate or unreliable information, your willful failure to update information provided to Registrar via AWS within seven days of any change, or any failure by you to respond for more than 15 days to inquiries by AWS or Registrar concerning the accuracy of Registration Data associated with your Registered Name, will constitute a material breach of the registration agreement between you and AWS and will be a basis for AWS or the Registrar to suspend or cancel your registration of the Registered Name.</p> 
           <p><b>3.6</b> Registered Names cannot be any domain name that is either a reserved name pursuant to ICANN policy or reserved by the Registry Operator for the gTLD or ccTLD.</p> 
           <p><b>3.7</b> If permitted by the Registrar and Registry Operator, you may use Private Domain Registration or a Proxy Domain Registration, but only in accordance with the Registrar’s or Registry Operator's terms (the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/amazon-registrar-policies/" target="_blank">Amazon Registrar policy page</a>, the <a href="https://www.gandi.net/domain/whois/" target="_blank">Gandi WHOIS page</a> , the <a href="https://www.domainbox.com/terms/">Mesh Digital contract page</a> or the policy page of any other Registrar AWS may use).</p> 
           <p><b>3.8 </b>With regard to any data requested from you by AWS in connection with your use of the Domain Name Registration Services (“DNRS Data”):</p> 
           <p><b>3.8.1 </b>AWS collects and processes DNRS Data, which includes the Registration Data, written communications relating to registration applications, confirmations, modifications, terminations, or any other correspondence with you as registrant, and our records indicating your acceptance of this Agreement, in connection with your request to register a Registered Name.</p> 
           <p><b>3.8.2</b> In order to provide you with services under this Agreement, AWS will share DNRS Data with the Registrar, and AWS, the Registrar, and the Registry Operator are required by ICANN and in some cases, the Registry Operator, to make certain DNRS Data publicly accessible via WHOIS, including by providing bulk access to DNRS Data. DNRS Data includes: the domain name; your name and postal address; the name, email address, postal address, voice and fax numbers for technical and administrative contacts; the Internet protocol numbers for the primary and secondary name servers; the corresponding names of the name servers; the original date of registration and expiration date; the name of the primary and secondary name servers; and the identity of the Registrar.</p> 
           <p><b>3.8.3</b> In order to provide you with services under this Agreement, the Registrar is required to make certain DNRS data available to ICANN and/or the Registry Operator for inspection and copying by ICANN and/or the Registry Operator. Registrar will share certain DNRS data with ICANN and/or Registry Operator to resolve compliance-related inquiries and respond to ICANN and/or Registry Operator audits.</p> 
           <p><b>3.8.4</b> In order to provide you with services under this Agreement, the Registrar and Registry Operator may be required to submit an electronic copy of certain DNRS Data to ICANN and/or Registry Operator from time to time. For gTLDs, the Registrar and Registry Operator must regularly submit an electronic copy of certain DNRS Data to an escrow agent mutually approved by the Registrar, Registry Operator, and ICANN to be held in escrow.</p> 
           <p><b>3.8.5</b> AWS may collect other DNRS Data in the course of providing the Domain Name Registration Services (e.g., while investigating complaints). In order to provide you with services under this Agreement, AWS may share DNRS Data with the Registrar, Registry Operator, and ICANN.</p> 
           <p><b>3.8.6</b> You may access and make corrections to your personal data through the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home" target="_blank">Route 53 console</a> .</p> 
           <p><b>3.8.7 </b>AWS may retain all such DNRS Data during the term of this Agreement and for two years thereafter, in order to comply with ICANN requirements, regulatory, and contractual requirements for the retention of such data.</p> 
           <p><b>3.8.8</b> You consent to such data processing of DNRS Data for the purposes, and with the limitations, described in this section and Section 3.9.</p> 
           <p><b>3.9</b> Regarding the DNRS Data described in Section 3.8, AWS agrees that:</p> 
           <p><b>3.9.1</b> AWS will not process the DNRS Data collected from you in a manner incompatible with the purposes and other limitations described in this section.</p> 
           <p><b>3.9.2</b> AWS will take reasonable precautions to protect the DNRS Data provided by you from any loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p> 
           <p><b>3.10</b> AWS will permit you to change the Registrant name, organization, or email of a Registered Name (“Change of Registrant”) in accordance with ICANN’s Transfer Policy for gTLDs and the transfer policy of the relevant Registry Operator for ccTLDs , provided that you agree to the conditions outlined in the Amazon Registrar Change of Registrant Agreement (“Change Agreement”) or the Change of Registrant process required by your Registrar and the terms of this Agreement.</p> 
           <p><b>3.10.1</b> A Change of Registrant does not necessarily include the renewal of the Registered Name’s registration, which must be expressly requested and paid for. AWS is not responsible for the expiration of a Registered Name that is the result of any failure to renew the registration of the Registered Name.</p> 
           <p><b>3.10.2</b> You authorize AWS to act as your designated agent for the purpose of approving a Change of Registrant request.</p> 
           <p><b>3.10.3</b> A new Registered Name Holder or their designated agent must expressly confirm their desire to accept your transfer of the Registered Name, and a New Registered Name Holder must expressly accept this Agreement.</p> 
           <p><b>3.10.4</b> You may be prohibited from requesting a Change of Registrant under certain circumstances, including (A) a dispute regarding the Registered Name or its use, (B) the account associated with the Registered Name is not current with all payments due to AWS, or (C) your registration of a Registered Name has expired.</p> 
           <p><b>3.10.5</b> You will remain bound to this Agreement for as long as you are identified in WHOIS records as the Registered Name Holder or for so long as any domain name remains in your account with us, even if WHOIS records identify a third party or you are using a Private Domain Registration or a Proxy Domain Registration.</p> 
           <p><b>3.11</b> You may transfer the sponsorship of a Registered Name either to or from another registrar under certain terms.</p> 
           <p><b>3.11.1</b> You will promptly furnish AWS with any information necessary to transfer the sponsorship of your Registered Name to or from another registrar, or to assist AWS with resolving any transfer dispute.</p> 
           <p><b>3.11.2</b> The Registrar will transfer the sponsorship of a Registered Name provided that you comply with ICANN’s <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/transfer-policy-2016-06-01-en" target="_blank">Transfer Policy</a> and pay any appropriate fees.</p> 
           <p><b>3.11.3</b> In the event of a dispute concerning the transfer of sponsorship of a Registered Name, the Registrar will attempt to resolve such dispute in accordance with <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/tdrp-2012-02-25-en" target="_blank">ICANN’s Registrar Transfer Dispute Resolution Policy</a> .</p> 
           <p><b>3.11.4</b> You may be prohibited from transferring sponsorship of a Registered Name to or from another registrar under certain circumstances, including (A) within the first 60 days following your registration of the Registered Name for some TLDs, (B) within the first 60 days following a Change of Registrant or transfer to a different registrar, (C) a dispute regarding the Registered Name or its use, (D) the account associated with the Registered Name is not current with all payments due to AWS, or (E) the registration of the Registered Name has expired.</p> 
           <p><b>3.11.5</b> In the event Amazon Registrar becomes accredited to sell TLDs that AWS had been registering through other registrars, you authorize AWS to transfer any Registered Names registered in these TLDs through other Registrars to Amazon Registrar on your behalf and take whatever administrative steps are necessary to accomplish such transfers including, but not limited to, temporarily changing the registrant and/or administrative contact email address. You explicitly authorize AWS to act as your designated agent to make and approve material changes of registration contact information on your behalf solely for the purpose of facilitating any such transfers. If you are not the Registered Name Holder for any Registered Name, then you represent and warrant that you are the designated agent for such Registered Name Holder and that the Registered Name Holder has granted you the necessary authority to make the changes set forth in this section.</p> 
           <p><b>3.11.6</b>&nbsp;You accept liability for harm caused by any use of the Registered Name by the third party.</p> 
           <p><b>3.12</b>&nbsp;If you register the Registered Name on behalf of a third party by providing AWS with a third party’s DNRS Data for the Registered Name, or otherwise permit a third party to be listed as the registrant in the WHOIS records of a domain name in your account, then (A) you will be considered a reseller as defined in the <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/approved-with-specs-2013-09-17-en" target="_blank">ICANN Registrar Accreditation Agreement</a> , (B) the third party will be considered your customer, and (C) you agree to following terms:</p> 
           <p><b>3.12.1</b> You will not display the ICANN or ICANN-Accredited Registrar logo, or otherwise represent yourself as Accredited by ICANN, unless they have written permission from ICANN to do so.</p> 
           <p><b>3.12.2</b> Any registration agreement entered into between you and your customer will include all registration agreement provisions and notices required by the ICANN Registrar Accreditation Agreement and any ICANN Consensus Policies, and will identify the sponsoring registrar or provide a means for identifying the sponsoring registrar, such as a link to the InterNIC Whois lookup service.</p> 
           <p><b>3.12.3</b> You will identify the sponsoring registrar of the Registered Name upon inquiry from your customer.</p> 
           <p><b>3.12.4</b> You will comply with any ICANN-adopted Specification or Policy that establishes a program for accreditation of individuals or entities who provide proxy and privacy registration services (a "Proxy Accreditation Program"). Among other features, the Proxy Accreditation Program may require that: (A) proxy and privacy registration services may only be provided in respect of domain name registrations by individuals or entities Accredited by ICANN pursuant to such Proxy Accreditation Program; and (B) you will not knowingly accept registrations from any provider of proxy and privacy registration services that is not Accredited by ICANN pursuant the Proxy Accreditation Program. Until such time as the Proxy Accreditation Program is established, you will comply with the Specification on Privacy and Proxy Registrations contained in the ICANN Accreditation Agreement.</p> 
           <p><b>3.12.5</b> You will provide your customer with a link to an ICANN webpage detailing Registrant Educational Information as described in Section 1.2 above.</p>

           <p><b>6.3</b> Maintaining your Registered Name registrations with AWS after any modifications to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, Uniform Rapid Suspension System, or any other ICANN-required or Registry Operator-required dispute policy become effective, will constitute acceptance of the policy as modified. You will review each dispute policy applicable to your domain name periodically to determine if modifications have been made to it. If you cancel or terminate your Services with AWS as a result of a modified dispute policy, no fees will be refunded to you.

          <div class="lb-rtxt"> 
           <p><b>7.1</b> Fees: Pricing for initial registrations, renewals, renewal after expiration, and redemption are available <a href="https://d32ze2gidvkk54.cloudfront.net/Amazon_Route_53_Domain_Registration_Pricing_20140731.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> .</p> 
           <p><b>7.2</b> Automatic Renewal. In order to ensure that you do not experience an interruption in Domain Name Registration Services or loss of a Registered Name, AWS offers an automatic renewal option (“Automatic Renewal”).</p> 
           <p><b>7.2.1</b> UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED FOR A SPECIFIC DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION SERVICE, AUTOMATIC RENEWAL WILL BE ENABLED BY DEFAULT.</p> 
           <p><b>7.2.2</b> Automatic Renewal automatically renews the registration of the applicable Registered Name for a renewal period of one year, unless the Registry Operator specifies a different renewal period.</p> 
           <p><b>7.2.3 </b>Unless you disable Automatic Renewal, AWS will automatically renew your registration of a Registered Name, and will take payment from the payment method you have on file with AWS at the then-current AWS rates, which may be higher or lower than the rates for the original service period. Domain name renewal fees are non-refundable.</p> 
           <p><b>7.2.4</b> Automatic Renewal settings are available under the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home?#DomainListing" target="_blank">Route 53 console</a> . You may enable or disable Automatic Renewal at any time.</p> 
           <p><b>7.2.5</b> Automatic Renewal will not be effective until payment is final. You are solely responsible for ensuring that the payment method you have on file with AWS is current and valid. If you do not have a current and valid payment method on file, then Automatic Renewal will not be available.</p> 
           <p><b>7.2.6</b> Automatic Renewal typically occurs thirty-five (35) days before the expiration date of the Registered Name and extends the registration for one year, however certain ccTLDs require that Automatic Renewal occur closer to the expiration date and may have longer renewal periods. You will review the specific renewal rules relating to the TLD for your Registered Name, which are available <a href="http://awsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Route53/latest/route53-dg.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> .</p> 
           <p><b>7.2.7</b> For renewals occurring thirty-five (35) days before the expiration date of the Registered Name, we will endeavor, but are not obligated to, send a renewal notification email reminding you that your Registered Name is set to Auto Renewal.</p> 
           <p><b>7.2.8</b> You are responsible for any renewals of your domain names. If you disable Automatic Renewal, if your payment method is rejected, or if Automatic Renewal is not available for your Registered Name, then as of the Expiration Date, you may experience an interruption of service or lose control of your Registered Name, and AWS will not be liable to you or any third party as a result.</p> 
           <p><b>7.2.9</b> AWS or Registrar will provide you with notifications of pending expiration, including a notification of the Expiration Date for your Registered Name, at least 1 month prior to the Expiration Date, 1 week prior to the Expiration Date, and 1 day after the Expiration Date. Notices will be sent to your email address on record, as provided in Section 11.1.</p> 
           <p><b>7.3</b> Expired Names. Failure to renew or transfer your registration of the Registered Name by the Expiration Date may result in a cancellation of the registration and a loss of all rights to the Registered Name. After the Expiration Date:</p> 
           <p><b>7.3.1</b> Within one day after expiration, the status of the expired domain name will be set to <a href="https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/epp-status-codes-2014-06-16-en#clientHold" target="_blank">clientHold</a> and the domain name will no longer be available on the Internet.</p> 
           <p><b>7.3.2</b> The actual length of the late-renewal period and other timeframes identified in this Section, are subject to the rules and requirements of the Registry Operator for the relevant TLD. Late-renewal period is not available for certain ccTLDs. You will review the specific expiration rules relating to the TLD for your Registered Name available <a href="http://awsdocs.s3.amazonaws.com/Route53/latest/route53-dg.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> .</p> 
           <p><b>7.3.3</b> AWS or the Registrar may, but are not obligated to, renew the expired domain name on your behalf. If AWS or the Registrar decide to renew the expired domain name, it will enter a late-renewal period lasting between forty (40) and forty-five (45) days. During this period, you may renew the domain name at the standard renewal rate.</p> 
           <p><b>7.3.4</b> If an expired domain name is not renewed during late-renewal period, it will be deleted from our system and will enter a thirty (30) day redemption period. During this period you may be able to restore your domain name. The price to restore the domain name depends on TLD. Standard pricing is available here . If you do not restore the domain name during redemption period it will be deleted at the registry level, enter general availability, and be available to anyone on a first-come, first-served basis.</p> 
           <p><b>7.3.5 </b>Only the Registered Name Holder is permitted to renew or restore an expired domain name during late-renewal period or redemption period. Renewals can only be processed through AWS and you will not be able to transfer your domain name to another registrar if it is in redemption period.</p> 
           <p><b>7.3.6</b> Registrar may modify the WHOIS data to reflect a change in ownership after the Registered Name expires.</p> 
           <p><b>7.4</b> Deletion. If you disable Automatic Renewal, or if Automatic Renewal is not available for your Registered Name, or as of the Expiration Date and if you have not made valid and final payment of all applicable registration and recovery fees by the end of the late-renewal Period, then the Registrar is required by ICANN to delete the Registered Name no later than 45 days after the Expiration Date (although some Registry Operators may require deletions earlier and some ccTLD Registry Operators may require deletions later).</p> 
           <p><b>7.4.1</b> AWS may, in certain extenuating circumstances specifically approved by ICANN for gTLDs or the Registry Operator for ccTLDs, required under a dispute policy, or mandated by a court of competent jurisdiction, renew a Registered Name without your explicit consent in order to prevent its deletion. Your failure to respond to expiration or renewal notices from AWS is not an extenuating circumstance.</p> 
           <p><b>7.5</b> TLD-Specific Rules. The Registry Operator for an individual TLD may implement specific rules which affect your ability to register, renew, and transfer Registered Names related to that TLD. These rules may allow for renewal or restoration pricing that is higher than that of initial registration or forbid the use of privacy or proxy services. You will review the specific rules relating to the TLD for your Registered Name, as available from the Registrar (the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/amazon-registrar-policies/" target="_blank">Amazon Registrar policy</a> page, the <a href="https://www.gandi.net/contracts" target="_blank">Gandi contract page</a> , or any other registrar AWS may use). Your acceptance of this Agreement signifies that you have read, understand, acknowledge and agree to be bound by all such agreements, guidelines, policies, practices, procedures, registration requirements or operational standards of the TLD in which you register any domain name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <div class="lb-rtxt"> 
           <p><b>8.1</b> During checkout for registration or transfer of a Registered Name, you will be prompted to choose the domain name server settings for the Registered Name.</p> 
           <p><b>8.2</b> In the event that you do not select any domain name server settings for the Registered Name, then AWS will configure the Registered Name to use default domain name server settings chosen by AWS in its discretion (the “Default Setting”). AWS may, in its discretion, use one of the following Default Settings:</p> 
           <p><b>8.2.1</b> AWS may use a Default Setting that does not direct the Registered Name to any web page, causing end users to receive a “server not found” message or similar message. AWS is not obligated to direct end users to a Parking Page or other web page by default.</p> 
           <p><b>8.2.2</b> AWS may use a Default Setting that directs end users to a Parking Page. AWS has sole discretion to determine the content of the Parking Page.</p> 
           <p><b>8.3</b> When you register or transfer in a Registered Name to Amazon Registrar, you will have the option to enable or disable Private Domain Registration. The option to enable Private Domain Registration will be selected by default.</p> 
           <p><b>8.4</b> During the registration process, you will be advised of the Default Setting, which will be applied to the Registered Name in the event that you do not provide the appropriate domain name server settings for the Registered Name. The “Default Setting” is that your hosted zone will be initially populated with a basic set of domain name server settings, including four virtual name servers that will answer queries for your Registered Name. You will be charged at the then-current price applicable to those services under the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/agreement/" target="_blank">AWS Customer Agreement</a>.</p> 
           <p><b>8.5</b> If the Default Setting is not acceptable to you, you are responsible for changing the Registered Name’s domain name server settings from the Default Setting. You may make changes to these settings on the Route 53 console.&nbsp;</p>

           <p><b>9.1 General Payment Terms</b></p> 
           <p><b>9.1.1 </b>You will make all payments for the Domain Name Registration Services, according to the prices and conditions applicable at the time of the order or renewal. You must have provided AWS with valid payment information in connection with your use of the Domain Name Registration Services, and that any request to register or renew a Registered Name will not be effective unless and until payment to AWS is final.</p> 
           <p><b>9.1.2 </b>You may make payments to AWS using a billing name and address separate from the names and addresses provided in the Registration Data.</p> 
           <p><b>9.1.3 </b>Prices and fees for using the Domain Name Registration Services are non-refundable unless otherwise expressly noted, even if your registration of a Registered Name is suspended, terminated, or transferred prior to the Expiration Date.</p> 
           <p><b>9.1.4</b> Prices and fees for Domain Name Registration Services, including registration, renewal, and restoring a domain name in redemption period are available at the <a href="https://d32ze2gidvkk54.cloudfront.net/Amazon_Route_53_Domain_Registration_Pricing_20140731.pdf" target="_blank">pricing page</a> . Automatic Renewals will be billed at the prices and fees applicable on the date the Automatic Renewal occurs. Registration and renewal prices are subject to change at any time. Fees and charges for any new service or new feature of a service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the Domain Name Registration Services site, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice.</p> 
           <p><b>9.1.5</b> AWS may charge an additional fee for Recovery Services used to recover a Registered Name that has expired due to your failure to renew your registration by the Expiration Date. Pricing for the use of Recovery Services is available on the pricing page.</p> 
           <p><b>9.2</b> <b>Premium Domains</b> AWS does not currently support the initial registration of Premium Domain Names. “Premium Domain Names” are any domain names for which the Registry Operator assigns non-standard or variable pricing. If you transfer a Premium Domain Name into Route 53, you must pay the non-standard fee designated by AWS, in their sole discretion, for the transfer of the domain name and any subsequent renewal of the domain name.</p> 
           <p><b>9.3</b>&nbsp;Automatic Renewal Payment Terms. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your payment and billing information is valid and current. AWS is under no obligation to renew your registration to the Registered Name if your payment and billing information is not current and valid. If your payment information on file with AWS is not current and valid, or if AWS is unable to finalize a transaction on the Automatic Renewal date, your Registered Name will not be automatically renewed and it will be your responsibility to effect a manual renewal in order to retain control of the Registered Name.</p> 
           <p><b>9.4</b>&nbsp;Taxes. All fees and charges payable by you are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties, including VAT and applicable sales tax. You will provide us any information we reasonably request to determine whether we are obligated to collect VAT from you, including your VAT identification number. If you are legally entitled to an exemption from any sales, use, or similar transaction tax, you are responsible for providing us with legally-sufficient tax exemption certificates for each taxing jurisdiction. We will apply the tax exemption certificates to charges under your account occurring after the date we receive the tax exemption certificates. If any deduction or withholding is required by law, you will notify us and will pay us any additional amounts necessary to ensure that the net amount that we receive, after any deduction and withholding, equals the amount we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required. Additionally, you will provide us with documentation showing that the withheld and deducted amounts have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.<br> </p>
